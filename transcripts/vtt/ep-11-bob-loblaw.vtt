Hi everyone I'm haven't. I'm Tracy and welcome to another round with have an interest.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We are very excited about what we have and store it is Mental Health Awareness

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Month may have mental health awareness month. So we're going to dedicate the bulk of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this episode maybe not one hundred percent but like a solid eighty five percent of this episode to talk

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.000
about mental

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
health our own issues and struggles and we're also going to have the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
first lady of the city of New

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
York. Shirley MacLaine I can't

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
believe we got this make. I mean excited though

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so she has her shot of the stigma campaign so we're going talk a lot about that when she's doing with New York City mental health care.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Also later on in the show we're going to see Job time as

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
a and I will debut my quiz writing skills

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with that is Jason Bateman great I mean I'm excited and nervous but first

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.000
let's start the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
show

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
such as the wrote this essay called when taking anxiety medication is a revolutionary act and tell the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
people about us the truth. So

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the essay is just about my life with anxiety disorder which

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I've had I swear like since I was born like I came out of the Will Michael Moore

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that lies about what's going on that I might say

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but just about me I'm like a super super

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
super jacket or what I thought was super shack it and then my gradually learning that I actually

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
having sighted

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
disorder going through the motions of preparing myself to actually go get a psychiatrist and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mike get medicine so hard. First of all just a hard thing to do

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
like finding a psychologist and getting them to give you medicine that will alter your brain chemistry

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
or jump

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
through is exhausting I started and that was so many

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
times so that part is difficult and also like we grow up in a society where we're taught

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that like if you need. Until like fix your brain there's something like wrong with

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
either you're

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
lazy if you later do it yourself whereas it will have to hire you not praying that

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it needed to take medicine back when you have the flu not by going to say oh well you know

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
just just try harder to write you know. And it's not about

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
like anxiety and depression is it there are their physical condition right. They should treat them the same

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
way with medicine and with therapy and stuff like that so it's a really long essay. Hopefully

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.000
it's a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
good read not along US from somebody like me. I don't read some

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of the writing it was hard because I didn't have the attention span all that A.D.D. fun fact.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So I thought about that in there too.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I mean I really appreciate it because there's just not enough conversations about being medicated

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
or the anxiety of like even figuring out how

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to navigate all the. Oh my God you know that now thinking

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is something that I like to do it like I try to speak very openly about it we both

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
do on Twitter and on the show in the stuff that we do because just because there's nobody like talking about it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
right and there's this feeling that like nobody else in the world is like anxious or depressed

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
when the reality is like basically everybody

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is you know and we just don't know it because like I fell quiet about it and it's such a lonely feeling

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and I want people to listen alone you know as not the only ones guys. It's OK.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I don't really write that much personal essay stuff about it because soccer writing.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I do kind of write generally about it about two I come out it more

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
from places like Tumblr where I really like we all know I love tumblr. Yeah but it has

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a really great like recovery community recovery sort of broadly being

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
like eating disorders mental health stuff that's like depression

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
anxiety schizophrenia or whatever like a whole range of things I feel like there's a really

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
nice supportive community on tumblr for these kinds of me so I write about like stuff like

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that but Evan you wrote a really really great post for Buzz Feed about like how to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
go about seeking out a doctor or you know how to start therapy. I had a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
star

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
therapy even that it's like. Seems like it should be a simple thing. It's like you're

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
already sick but you still have to take on this task is this path it takes a lot of energy

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because you're depressed especially like you don't have energy to care of yourself anyway. You wrote it because

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I needed it like I do this I've done it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
before but through school it's a different context. But yes. Our whole goal is to like

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
have resources for people who are like just frustrated not to the conversation

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
so we're going to get into all of this with the first lady and really get into sort of like the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
racial stuff about needing to see brown women talking about. Who who will mental

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
health stuff and then get into all of that but first let's have not done yet let's have

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
some fun although.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I hate watching movies to be honest because most of them are trash.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But the other day I was like yeah let me let me watch a movie haven't seen one in a while let me keep up with it if you want to.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And like there are like a million Jason Bateman movies on Netflix. Funny

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
thing is I know they exist but I cannot name a single and that's because they're all just the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
last like a few minutes why have you seen horrible but I

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
think the editors tool. OK. Anyways we'll get back to it it's just

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
frustrating because most movies have the same like. Five plots or like than

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
five people and it's just

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
like it's frustrating on why people have so much access to movies and they have the nerve to be bad at it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
like they do the same thing over anyway so Jason Bateman I

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
notice plays literally the same. Average like middle aged white dude

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
who's like kind of a little rise on the human I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
think he's like an architect or like you know. I mean

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I loved him in Arrested Development that's kind of where I think he

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
got this typecasting got started I was going through.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I.M.D.B. and watch over the development. OH MY GOD YOU'RE LIKE

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
together. So I mean this quiz because I was like oh my god. Names of Jesus

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and the humans character.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Las like in just like such a stereotypical middle aged white guy

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
named Chad and shit. Well. Tracy I'm going to make you take

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
this Christofer out what the real name is and what are the white names I just made up.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
OK OK

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So in each of these questions one of the names will be that of an actual Jason

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Bateman character and the other two are white men names I just made up.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
OK I'm ready when you like my game day I'm a Bobby. We

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
also mean like in a line boy against that white

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
man I had an of the best Tonight Show music why did I

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
say let's go with that was what I guess that white man. All right so

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the X. is a movie from two thousand and six where Jason Bateman plays a dude

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
who annoy Zach Braff in the office he just annoys him.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
There's a whole OK I thought it was OK I'm not going to get into it OK While that's Cool Disco hear

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the three options trees you know that General. Is this man named

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Willard Romney.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So will it around the light is shining on ever higher. Oh my God

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
where he's not a real person I would pick the obviously process of the

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
law myself not will it really. This is a bit. Can it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Kenneth Preston

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
chip Sanders. I don't want to believe they're actual white men run around and shit is

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
your answer Ken it's Preston is that your final answer

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
yes wrong then there

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000

let's go another on this which is a movie from two thousand and ten involving a

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
wild plotline about switching sperm donors. So

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.000

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Declan Newman Archie Colin or Wally Mars.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
blah blah blah blah so I've left my job.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Oh you want to be my I want to live. But can we all just a shout out to my white dude

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
named it like so much money that was a bomb or not I'm actually amazed to be a big thank

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
or I agree but if you say let me name your

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
child

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
we are so very excited for our next guest thrilled. We

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
have the first lady of New York City all Miss Shirley McRae here she's

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the chair of the Mayor's Fund to advance New York City a nonprofit organization that focus on supporting public

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
programs in areas including mental

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
health and support for young men and women of color. And also recently

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
you announced that there's going to be an investment of seventy eight point three

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
million dollars to my counseling and treatment and a lot of mental health care in the New York

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
City area and you are also on Twitter and Tumblr and I love it and you're

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
frequently talking about your mental health advocacy through the touch tag shatter the stigma.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Welcome to the show for yet were they happy to have you know we might be getting a new gadget I know

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
you have I'm so excited to be

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
here in a way that we like to kick off all of our interviews.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Even though we know who you are obviously what you do we like to hear in your own words.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So the first question that we ask is What do you do and why. What do I

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
do and why it is a good question I ask myself that every

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
day I think myself as

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
a changemaker I came here to you know mix things up and get people

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
on a more positive track. That's you know when I when I break it all down. This is what I'm

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
here to do I spend most of my days being of not taking care of

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
myself or take. Other people. That's what I'm

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
doing so what motivated you to be such a big mental health

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
advocate. Well you know it's personal because I have all through

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
my life I've experienced this what I call it invisible

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
conversation things happening to people around me that nobody wants to talk

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
about my parents suffered from depression and never understood their

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
behavior like why my father withdraw and that there's certain ways and why my mother would be

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
so sad

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and you know only now my coming to an understanding of what was going

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
on and more recently my daughter came to us and said that she was diagnosed with

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
anxiety and depression and addiction and as it was

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
just very clear to me

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that we have to do something we've got to start talking about this war

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because it's not just me and my family it's every family

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
has experiences like mine as I've been out in communities talking with people I found

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
out you know one in five Americans has a diagnosable mental health challenge.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Maybe that's a lot of people like everybody else exactly. No one is

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
not touched by this and yet it's something that we don't really talk about it's something we

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
don't provide adequate services for and there's a huge stigma about getting treatment.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
What were the conversations like about mental health in your household growing up in like how do you think

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
about those conversations now in your own

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
household where we didn't talk about it in a way that really

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
reference mental health the thought was and in those days you

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
know you you you just you tough you tough it out right you work

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
harder you

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
just go to church you pray

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
you put on the happy face for the people around you and then

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
you know later on yes maybe you go to a doctor but it was it was very

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I had no shameful. Yeah it wasn't something that we didn't

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
have all the medications we have now we didn't have. I think

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
we we've got so much stuff right we've got a level of sophistication.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
In addition to medications we've got all kinds of consonance treatment that we didn't have back

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
then so it will it was I think

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
partly there was so much shame because there really weren't kinds of

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
solutions that we have now.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So how do you talk about this with your children

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
now koma good now I'm well I'm learning so much from my children

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
because we've come a long way not far enough that we've got a long way I mean that

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
initial moment of like talking to your parents about your mental health stuff is really hard. What was that

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
moment like it shook

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
me to my core who really did I just I want to I want to

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
cry I was a for so afraid for her I didn't know what to

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
do it

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
was really tough you know it's really

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
tough you know I just loved her that we took she to so she's so

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
open and so communicative and that really is like the first step to

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
healing is like being able to talk about it being able to reach out to

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
someone and she was doing that and I knew this is really hard

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
it's hard but we're going to we're going to get there we're going to get to the

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
next step because you know we're it we're we're talking together and we've got

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
that love you know that that strong sense of family.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I write and talk a lot about my variances with anxiety disorder which I was officially diagnosed with in

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
my twenty's and my original plan was to not feel anybody like my best

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
best friend because I didn't want to tell my mom about

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
it and when my biggest worries was that I didn't want her to feel like she had done something

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
wrong or that he was a failure and I also didn't want him to like look at me as like weak

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
or like I mean were very like jokey family and I was like I don't want you to like take it easy on me you

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
know like I don't like treat me like I'm made out of

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
glass but eventually I came to understand in that they are trying to understand me because they

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
had never like even thought about what it's like to like to be worried for Nari. And so

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I think that's a ask if you could give advice to parents who learn that their

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
children are going through what would you say to them.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Well first I have to thank you for writing that piece I read it and I was like oh you are

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
SO is so brave of you so courageous and the piece was

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
beautifully written off and you know it really touched me you know I think

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
very we need to get it out some more yes absolutely I think you know a

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
lot of important information about

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
this and and as for other parents. I just you know I think parents have

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
to literally listen to their

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
children and if they feel like something's not right as

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
they should trust their instincts because sometimes the child may not know what's going

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
on and it really requires a deeper

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
conversation with the parents not ready to have a deeper conversation might want

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
to find somebody who could help with that and it is important not to

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
blame yourself. Yeah every mom every dad what to be perfect

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
right this is like our most important job raising up our young ones but we don't have complete

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
control over nature over genetics the room by room and so

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
we need to.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Be easy a little easier on as cells and just see how to do the best we can. That's great and I

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
think number is all about the loving

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
me when I was first diagnosed with depression. I remember feeling like I don't even think this

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
is the thing that applied to me I've been raised that the idea of like a strong

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
black woman.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Oh yes so I was just like well this is the way life is hard I just have to deal with it and

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
you can be said pray on it and in your

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
work you talk about a lot about race and mental health and really bringing that element into the

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
conversation because I don't I don't even have that vocabulary yet and I didn't even

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
know this is a thing black people dealt with

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
yeah right. Right and we actually deal with it and you know much higher percentage and

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
then on and many other folks because well. There is

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
racism there is trauma. There is poverty and all of those

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
things exacerbate life right. And if you live with

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
stress for a long period of time it really builds up and builds up and then becomes

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
what we call toxic stress and trauma and it's much harder

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
to make a comeback from that. So it's very important for people

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
to you know I get and get it early. You know you feel like something's not right reach

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
out yeah and op ed you wrote for The Root you cited a statistic that says African-Americans are twenty percent more

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
likely than their white counterparts to report experiencing serious psychological distress. I mean that's the kind

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.000
of doubt it we're

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
doing right now there was also a statistic that said that we are forty percent less likely

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
to seek out help for it. That's right which is it just crushes me to hear

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
that instead there are still many of us is out there just like struggling not only with just like whatever

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
our brain chemistry is doing but like seeing our brothers and sisters murdered like

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
via

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
video is draining it's tiring it makes me feel like helpless in moments like this we

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
talk a lot about self care on this show to let you how do we take care of myself when it's just like too much.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
What is your self care routine where you take care of yourself.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
First let me say that when you see other people going through stuff I was important for us as

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
black women encourage them to get help you know we don't have enough services out there but you

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
know still need to encourage people to get help There's doesn't have to be professional help sometimes

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
just talking to

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
one and encourage people to self care. I have a lot of tools that

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
you know this morning I was listening to TALK to come on and indeed I

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
really I was like really helped me boost my mood there was a real thing I

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
love to move around

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
a dance saying and is a big thing for me. I love

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
nature so walking and walking around the garden looking at plants

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
just being in touch with the earth helped me so much poetry

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
writing I got it

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
so the longer you write. If you can tell me more and I love working through my

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
emotions using you know using words. And that's it's very

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
helpful in my estimation it seems like the mental health conversation is

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
having a bigger moment right now. How do you see that in the sort of

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
larger conversation what are the seven seventy eight point three million actually going through

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Yes Well first of all I say that we just we have so much more information now than we

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
did twenty thirty years ago about about mental health and and what it takes

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
to prevent problems from starting and how to treat

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
them and I think that's what we're seeing just everywhere like people are starting to talk about it because

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
we have solutions.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
We have evidence based research we know what to do we know that the average age of

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
onset of mental illnesses is fourteen. But the point is that it could

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
happen any time you know the time child. Warren up until you know like twenty's thirty's

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
whatever it's something to look for we know the signs and symptoms we

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
know what to look for so when young person gets to college and that's

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
actually that first year is a really traumatic time and may times.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
That's when things break down and a lot of

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
little experience there like mental health stuff in their early twenty's that you know the college years.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
That's right activates everything that's already well.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
So it's good to marry watch

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
back I think that that that conversation that public conversation

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
we're having is because like OK we know what's happening and then the next step is we

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
like what do we actually do about it and and and stigma is

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
something that I'm very deeply concerned about and one of the reasons we

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
are putting money into all these different areas are runaway shelters

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
are homeless shelters are domestic violence justice

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
centers we know that

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
people who are in trauma are most

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
vulnerable having whatever's going on with them made

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
much worse right. So it's a lot of them. Are you going to service based

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
organization that's going into yes to into mental like mental health clinics schools.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
OK so that children will

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
have services mental health services where they go to school and

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
then move shelters will have services where they are and that's the other things like to make the

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
services accessible. We need to expand our number of providers.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
We need culturally competent providers I

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
mean if you speak Cantonese you speak Spanish right. Well they want language you speak

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
like we're going to see you this is Mrs New

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
York and any urban centers going to have this issue of like not necessarily

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
having the providers where people are and not home providers who actually are understood

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
who understand the people that not just the language but the the culture the

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
greatest chance because

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
this seriously. It is

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
just people have to be comfortable in going to get

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
help this isn't a fantastic conversation I

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
was happy for ever and ever and ever but

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
we did the lady and you have tons to do so we have this kind

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
of weird but also fun.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
You don't miss that we literally you know it's a little weird the segment

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
is called pew pew pew pew rapid fire rapid fire questions.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
OK so we just have like

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
some very random very casual informal questions about you know you

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
much into it cetera et cetera. First question how do you feel about

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
girls I heard you're going to ask this question I want to know that I was not

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
able to just only know we're all what I thought was my nickname for my summer so I

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
can come slow my life but I don't like sports. I just say right because

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
you know that

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
right now this

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
is there a literal key to the city.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
I've always wanted to do with my not a little crazy but you know and I get a break was

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
the mile and a good attitude will get you anywhere you. Want to get there you go.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.000
What is

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
your favorite sitcom from the ninety's.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Oh I'm going to say fresh French.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Yes actually

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
has anyone ever touched your hair without asking since you've been first lady.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
You know. OK. Really you know this is a very important question from

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
heaven do you watch The Good Wife. Oh my

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
fall was actually on want to he deliver a cameo I was so happy I thought

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Oh yeah and I was sort of one of

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
our favorite shows. I think it's a very interesting show for women in politics.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Do you feel like the women you meet in your political life are represented in that

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
show they are yeah but this even wore his I think there's so much

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
more we could be seeing on television to represent the real women who

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
are out in the world doing this kind of work

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
absolutely. So do you still find the time to write poetry. Yes

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I don't have enough time and I don't have much time as I want to but yes I do.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Was your favorite character on The Good Wife.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.000
It's

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000

believe you're laying on the trailer and she's just she's so smart.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Some people just walk into a room and it feels like warmer and that's let me smile I'm not a now. Look.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000

sees just how you know that's

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
fine or I remembered. I want to build

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
the suspense. It's just sufficiently built. OK I'm excited.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So this is a joke that was

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
actually told to me a couple of days ago by a new friend Francesca levy a guy.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
It's a great joke a very good. So there's this

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
guy name is Bob. OK I'm Bob Francis

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Bob Loblaw. Absolutely

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
not Bob's only guy they go through a pet

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
store you tell the guy hey I'm looking for a companion or else I'm the company's something that'll

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
be happy to see me when I come home what do you

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
have and the guys like that just thing coming to the back. So I go to the back of

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
the store like in some weird fat room or something produces a mason jar.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
In the mason jar is full of like grass and

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
leaves and it's got little puncture holes in the top and he's like What is it in

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
the store owners like if you look closely you'll see a caterpillar. And

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
I like wow you mean academies. But this is not just any regular

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Caterpillar Baba my friend Caterpillar the name is Jerome of

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
course. Jerome is a great friend and his favorite thing

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
to do is go down to the pub and have a drink the caterpillar. Caterpillar likes to go for

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
a pub in

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
the meat and then I hear myself after what club. Oh

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
OK You know me I stand up a little bit in this universe rather polar absolutely close to

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
the bob. Yes frequently. Oh no he just he's a super Chilcat All right

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
we're all right you know I don't need

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
to be like Mr clubs every night is not really my thing

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
chilled you

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
know he does well. Go to the bar have a drink. OK mom's like well I don't know about

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
this means I'm well he's also a great conversationalist. And

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Bob's like you tell me this kind of how we can talk now while

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
he would be more surprised at a talking Caterpillar than he would a

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
caterpillar that go so well what is a drink I don't know things are beyond did

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
an interesting type of dude but he's like you tell me this got a pelican talking about oh yeah you love talking

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
about politics and art you

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
know everything in Bob's like OK what I would like to have some great conversation and

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I would also like to go down to the pub to have a drink so as I write

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
I would take this capitalist or thank you so bile scoop

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
subzero in his little mason jar home take him to his house and for a while

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
they just kind of look at each other you know Bob looking to roam your room. And there's

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
just looking at

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Bob and eventually he takes the top off of the

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
jar and bobs like so drew on what he won

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000
today and he waits during that and say anything.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.000
This is like OK

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
well maybe maybe we should talk about politics so he's like oh man did you see that

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
last election debate whatever you know you know what it what do you think about this new development

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
in the in the political world and so he

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
waits you didn't say anything

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
when suddenly like OK maybe maybe talking is not your thing is I do you want to go down to the pub

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
and have a drink. And he put his ear up to the driver who might maybe

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
be talking with his left Caterpillar tiny Maybe I just hear him say

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
places and he waits for a

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
response. He doesn't get

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
anything that he's like well maybe he just can't hear me like maybe there's something in like the mechanics of a

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
caterpillar ear. Whatever I don't know and so he can try and he's

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
really trying to to be Drome the caterpillars fly in and so then he put his mouth like right up

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
to the Johnnies like

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
hey do you want to go down to the pub and get a

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
drink drones is nothing. And so Bob is like OK I'm getting real pissed

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
off and getting real fed up and he picks up the joint he's about to throw it go

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
all and smash. But before he does he said I'm ask you one more time.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Do you want to go down to the pub for a drink or not and then the Caterpillar

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
says I heard you I'm putting my shoes

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
on

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:24.000
I

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.000
J

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
C N N N

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:38.000
N

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
So we asked you all to

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
send in a voice recording the pettiest reason you've ever broken up

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
and we've got some great

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
responses. Then what he's really the best idea I've ever had i love you all just wanted so much.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
It was so hard to pick just a few to play again we've Riyadh here the you see Take a listen to a

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
few of the men I really got all of that and they

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
say they keep coming in to listen

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
to the pettiest reason I've

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
ever broken up with someone

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
because that man could not multiply he bought this

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
jacket and was really set on wearing it. His

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
dick was like the largest physical thing I've ever seen on the planet and let

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
me tell you about this like you know when they're like fascinated by a large animal like a horse

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
or something but you're like I'm going to stay over here because like it might kill

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
me and it was for trams and along the hood it also has

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
like gold stitching in it and some weird pattern

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Gucci man their least favorite foods were chocolate peanut butter

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
and jelly sandwiches and fried

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
chicken really really broke with like a beautiful deep purple like purple like Barney purple.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Maybe they didn't use theirs for properly.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
He cheated on me with this otherworldly chick. It was like eight or.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Mediated algebra like twenty five times

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
two I can

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
reconcile being with somebody who doesn't believe that

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
fried chicken is a gift from God

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
that Jesus did not anoint fried chicken with all of his beauty

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
and glory for us to enjoy he chose to do to

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
man and I look over and I kind of like fixate on this year it's like the

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.000
most you know

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
was the most god awful ugly thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
They have food on their cheese their forehead their eyebrows the back of

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
their head

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
whatever I can not

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
know he would not go and get my

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
scrutiny this brother took the gator or a bottle and threw

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
it out the one below call my face I made him take me home. A Maybe at

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
least I will fold the straw I'll just come believe they can get this

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:09.000
littered but he was a cool dude I hope he finally learned how to multiply by two.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
So

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
the real is and said it was the girl I was like he

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
would love you and I mean Capitol Hill are you sure would not like it.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
I feel you girl really. Well yes you are our hero of the day. Thank you so much

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
for submitting you. Our question for next month is what is the

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
wildest workplace microaggression experience. Oh my God. What's the

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
wasn't OK OK so I have natural hair and. You know that thing where when you

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000

Oh my gosh is that always oh my gosh here girls all said I'm a little me

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000

I really hate is oh I barely recognize you have you never seen. My face.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
OK So what happened. OK so little happened when it happened. I used to work in this really teeny

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
tiny

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
office and there was this one woman who always had some slick to say about my hair like you would

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
introduce me to her kids like her actual clients is a white woman is very white woman I mean I just

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
assumed she was like Tracy with the crazy hey

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I'm on my own reason for a Z. That's

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
how she would introduce me to people who come into the

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
office one day I mean my my hands were raggedy so I had to get it trimmed and I got it straight and I was like oh
