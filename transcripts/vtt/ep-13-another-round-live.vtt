00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
started a few

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
weeks ago I did a little thing called Jason Bateman

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.000
quiz

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
where he's been played a lot of middle aged white dude. So I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
was like Wow I bet I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
could name can make up as many Jason Bateman names as he already has

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
yes yes I'm going to do that again. But for this crowd specifically.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So this little quiz is this a white dude who works at public

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
radio

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or just some syllables I'm not together. Are

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.000

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to I am so let me say that I've failed miserably at the dating they mostly is you know

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
OK less you would not have to be nice to me I'm a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
big girl but I don't know anybody in public radio

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
so the I I mean all these with knowing Tracy's weaknesses as a true friend.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Public radio white dude name. Are you ready for this quiz Yes.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Which of these dudes is the real guy who works in public

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
radio. OK one step blotter.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Guy

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Raz. Or Tobias

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
a car bladder like a book. The L A T E

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
R OK not much big Iraq as Tobias tars

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm going to say that the actual white guy is.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The second to second guy rat yes that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is correct.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Thank you for if you know I'm

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
sorrow itself is just.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm going to guess.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Dizzy and

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
or vendor Hago is incorrect to tear

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
is Johnson is a real

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
it

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
did seem Shapiro is the name of the lobbying firm of the former House Speaker Dennis

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Hastert

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
who was recently indicted by a federal grand jury.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Wow Well it's not a real white guy's name it's a combination of two

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
white chicks let me in for a question. OK. But I

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
saw that in The Washington Post as I got to put that in the quiz. I

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
thought that's how the comeback that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000

love right.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
past year began three for you

were you putting about in a free one right though you got one out of five.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I think. Ladies and gentleman Tracy put the number down

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.000
for

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
the

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
balance pretty sad. I'd rather

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
not another tearing up a little bit because I'm sure that poor

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
performer just getting in my face though.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.000

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
think stray sees

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Bob take the pig to live in area one day that name is Durham about that I

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
know that nobody was up in their own green

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
space yet. So the guy

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
walked in with the painting that it was like sleeping right so he puts it on the table. Bob's like

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that I don't know what's wrong with my period has been sleep for a long time. He hadn't eaten in

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000

bit then he walks over to Jerome he looks at him and he barks twice and he gives him a sad look and

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
an operation and it. In this is just

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
his truth is.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Your own to the little that would have been forty dollars without the lab report and the cat

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000
scan

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000

Not easy but you did

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
not really got a great.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Now for the moment you've all been waiting for another joke.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We are so unbelievably excited to have Roxanne get here with

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.000
toes to get

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
that they got to try to get it

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
so

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
back after

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
hanging out I'm glad to be here. Oh is that what have you. We have a thousand

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
questions to ask. Let's start when you go back a bit. Oh

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
oh cat

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
scan the she said in the report. So

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that the

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
labs don't know if they don't you swap them around the world I've got the

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
so I just need to know where you learned

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that you make it up yourself and not that clever.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Ok I'm up for my good don't claim

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that I'm glad I did that other level when

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I made everybody. All right well. Well

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
differences aside I think we can

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
still get there that sounds like

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
everybody here knows all about you and what you do but we like to start every interview by

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
asking what do you do and

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
why. I am a connoisseur of Lifetime

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
movies

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
you know what I do I write and I write because for me writing is like breathing. It's

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
kind of self medication. So I write. Just because I can't imagine doing

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
anything else and I have a lot of opinions and apparently I feel the need to express

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
them

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
constantly My dad says you know you have a lot of opinion OK.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
The fact that you know you have a lot

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
opinion as you are doing some

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
background research I didn't realize

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
you went to exit or Andy Yale. Do you feel like the

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
right to try a bit down low or into the street. Thank you

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
for the

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
blanks and like those sort of like higher education institutions prepared you for being

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.000
in

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
academia. No no yes yes and no they prepared me

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
for a little dealing with white

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
people speak on it you know the

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Aka academia. Yes. So yeah that. Reguard Absolutely.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Mostly they prepared me to think for myself

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
because elite institutions there's

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
oftentimes a singular way they want you to think and I

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
refused and so it worked out pretty well and it certainly prepared me for how I want to teach

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and how I don't want to

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
teach real. So you are

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
sort of in a pretty rare position where you had two books come out in the same year.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Time magazine called twenty fourteen the year Roxanne day which

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
is I have another book coming out about food. Can you tell us a little bit about that book.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Yes my next book is called hunger. It's theoretically coming out

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
in May or June twenty sixth seen. OK you're radically. And so I'm writing about learning

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
to cook late in life in part but it's memoir about obesity and what it's like to have a morbidly

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
obese body in this

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
world culturally where such bodies are oftentimes

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
treated in really degrading ways and so what does it mean to move through the world when your body doesn't fit anywhere.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And it's called

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
hunger you were tweeting about how the oppressive didn't

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
is of New York City kind of hedging on edge. Oh

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
God yes on it

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I am telling

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
you these women where they're like ten inch heels and then they walk down the

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
sidewalk like

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
missiles that are like. Look I'm trying

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
to stay out of your way but I can't get myself I can't like be part of the

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
building I can only

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
walk through it. Yes. Is there some place where you feel the most

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
comfortable physically itself in your in your body like it feels like home and like

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.000
normally natural to

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
you not really but the Midwest. Definitely it's easier that

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I went Oh yeah and you know you go to these cities and you realize

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
wow people in the Midwest are are healthy are yes that

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
was yes thirty folk that's. And then you come to the city and

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
it's like oh yeah. OK So you know it is hard to feel like comfortable and like you belong.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
When you like to go to every event it's a bunch of like sin people wearing high high heels in tight jeans and it's

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
like just let your genitals

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Griese pants are too tight What about the

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
babies that my need to come in and I know rightly I mean and I see so many men in really

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
tight dark denim and Nokia's I just think they're not going to reproduce

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
that way you have to free the testicles. So I was very free

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
to test the and so you

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
have a third book coming out and well a fourth book sorry and

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I was talking to a book agent friend of mine and she was kind of suggesting she's.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That books especially memoir essays style books from women are

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
like kind of having a moment. Hold on hold

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
on I'm going to release an admission so I let me stop there are going to write

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
on her suggestion was

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
that it's annoying that you have to kind of phrase it that way but in

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
real terms. People are actually more and more interested in these kinds of

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
books do you feel like from your position. You see that in the publishing world or are

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
you not that hopeful. Take

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
you to fly or to sign my contract so I can see what I want.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Yeah I said yeah as the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
back bad off you know I

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.000
think

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
that women are expected to bare their souls

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and excavate their past and their present and their future and

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
that's what publishing is interested in this sort of cannibalizing of the

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
self and that men aren't expected to do the same the same things so I don't think we're having a moment I

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
think that we're just recognizing what has long been

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
true but that said that doesn't mean we don't have things worth telling and that are

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
necessary to tell and it's a question of how much agency you allow yourself to have

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
when you are pulling. From your life and writing memoir.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
You know jesting women are apt to write memoirs more.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Yes absolutely. OK I think women are inordinately asked to write

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
memoir and not taken as seriously when we want to write.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Literary nonfiction investigative

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
nonfiction fiction or anything it's like the only thing we're allowed to

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
be authorities on is ourselves.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Yes you know as I said it I was like oh that's

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:37.000
good

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I used to say I would never write memoir as a way of resisting that but

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
then it's like they when like because I'm controlling what I'm going to do to make a

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
point and they're continuing to just be ignorant and

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
so I've tried to find a happy compromise by working with

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
an editor who doesn't expect me to cannibalize who's like interested in what I actually have to

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
say how I choose to say it and that has been

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
wonderful Has anything surprised you by the way your work is talked about or maybe even the way

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
it's marketed.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Marketed know the marketing has been I feel really good. I'm really happy with the marketing

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
and I felt really involved in the entire process which is rare. But I felt really

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
lucky the way my work is talked about is hilarious to tell me all

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
right well. It depends. There's one line one line in

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.000
the

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
book and there's a group of women mostly who have picked up on this

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
line and will not let it go and I wrote about how I'm not super well versed

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
in feminist texts. So there's a group of people who feel like I should be able to talk

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
about. But I think if you read the book you realize that I quote.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Many feminist texts in the book so that was just like one line that people. I mean they're like

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
you don't know anything about feminism. OK take the Judas

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Butler. And shove it up your ass

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
the

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Falcon still on that note your Twitter

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
is amazing for a lot of different reasons. But one of my favorite things to watch you do is to just

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
like shit people down. With out and

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
capsule with with out

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
of your mama's a bitch and whatever happened and I just think

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
that quasi cop in the quiet beat my back if you will I will fight I will

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
do I went like my version of

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
the classic wetback you just mean like you're not smart and then like the conversation is over but you

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
just have like a finesse integrate in dislike. How do you not how you

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
engage in these

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
conversations because they can be physically and emotionally draining they're extremely Yeah you do

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
it a lot and well yeah like with like

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
call them and do you know that they are no i don't care if you don't

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
see it. Well it's a couple things like for a long time I said

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
nothing and I ignored the quote unquote trolls but I think you ignore and you ignore and they keep talking their

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
shit

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
and I'm tired of just like letting

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
you talk badly about me and all them incorrectly like when they just get

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
factual information wrong.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I have to say something but I also try to approach it from just a really

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
calm place of just you're an idiot but I'm going to tell you why in a really good way

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
and then go with that and I try not to curse too much

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
because my dad secretly reads my Twitter

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
feed Why Dad I think my mom read minds oh my

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
God Oh yeah like the latter night of the love of the pot

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
guess nobody told you guys. I

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
don't I don't tell them much

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
about my career but they follow like stockers And so last night my mom called and said

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
What store are told you to go find the lower priced items in the back. It was twenty minutes after

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I had

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
tweeted and she's like your father told

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
me that yes

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I. No he told you because she doesn't she respects my boundaries.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I'm

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
sorry the sixty nine thousand people following me can know what's going on Brad not you.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
So I keep them in mind also when I'm on Twitter talking to these people like how would they want me

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
to

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
engage with the sort of negativity and they've always been

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
really good about standing up for themselves but also

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
taking not the high road but the strong road and so that

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
is also a great motivating motivating factor when I talk to these people.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Patti to said who to respond to and what conversations to engage in and which to ignore.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And even like even in your writing not just on Twitter. I feel like you are pretty topical

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
and that's pretty draining to respond to all the like racist shit sexist it whatever like whatever happened

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
that week to respond to it like how do

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
you decide. Depending on Twitter it just depends on my mood oftentimes

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I'm just irritated so that's a great way to bring hope my you might do the same and I do it

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
and I do it

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
until my best friend. Tells me to stop one way or another like basically the boss

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
of me and so. Yes I have a boss sometimes

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
she'll just e-mail me stop or I'll be a text or hurdle between

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
like at the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
moment but there was no one's wrong on the I don't

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
know I try

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
to respond to the things that I feel moved to respond to things that I feel I have something

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
valuable to say if I don't have something valuable or if I don't feel like I have enough

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
authority to do so then I just pass it by like.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I have a lot of opinions about Caitlin Jenner coming out and the way

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
she posed for Vanity Fair

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
and I know my lane so I can have opinions and I can discuss them with my

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
friends but I'm not going to write an essay about it I'm going to read and I'm primarily going to read what

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
other trans gender people have to say about it I really

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
appreciated but was very. Here there is

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
the interesting conversation. The Atlantic passive coats wrote about the militia

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Harris Perry being America's foremost public intellectual when he wrote

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
that some people didn't respond worldwide people want to

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
think they were I think

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
this is likely by Norman Byers a political the media reporter. I'm actually writing have to worry about

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
that really good homes are you bring this up. Well I want to

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
ask you if you consider yourself a public intellectual because you kind of say that

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
the sort of you are really involved in media writing but you're also an

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
academic and you very purposely and pointedly say you want to have your

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
language be accessible and you're trying to blend high minded topics with sort

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
of accessible language.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Do you consider yourself a public intellectuals.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Not really but I know other people do and I realize that increasingly I'm seen

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
that way which I'm OK weighs I just see myself as a writer.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Well what are you writing about it I'm writing about the rise of the black public

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
intellectual yet a part

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
of my history

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
yeah yeah. Hopefully it's going to be a cover

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
story for a

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
magazine someone

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
in the I'm not used to have a lot of white

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
waiters that could be and

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
he's know all about your writing from all

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
of them. OK So I think we don't have that my time so I would

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
like to switch gears a little bit question I heard a rumor about a bad

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
feminist T.V. show and you yes or that are in talks with

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
some T.V. people about something. T.V. things are

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
are percolating

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
leave the part of the audience what they had sent me

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
and that's the thing I've learned about T.V. is that nothing is certain but I'm working

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
on three different show ideas and I'm trying to show the

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
right.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
As soon as anything becomes definite trust you I'm going to keep the shit to

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
myself to be like hey you

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
know this is happening I'm so excited because I

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
like the people that. Oh my God I'm so

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
excited for me but I'm also excited for like six year old me who got picked on a lot.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Did you need any terrible actresses I'm available to them I guess. All

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
right so I really would like to uptick if I'm in with

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
you

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
doing well if it happens and that I don't think you know.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So we know about your love of shooting the magic

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000

I know it came out May twenty second yell This is a real movie the real

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
thing they want to say you know and I came out on it

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
was the first after all

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Peter's chocolate city. Now that you know are you

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
interested in would you like to schedule a girls' night

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
with no

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
man yet

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
because I need to go see San Andreas tomorrow. That's just something that has

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
to happen but if you've seen the rock

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
lately. We're trying to have him on the show

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
I just want to bring him on and I will

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
fly here. When it happens.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
He's just so yes ever since he started being in Fast and Furious the best show the best movie ever.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
He's just so in his eyes and

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
then you know and we want somebody who was probably his next head yesterday and I

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
can get

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
his chest and then he does a little thing

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
that gives me you know he's a freak you know me oh.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I can come and come in big enough you know he just takes the woman or

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
man and send them away. And then like pops them

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
on another runs around the room. Sometimes you

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
just need to be thrown around I heard. I mean we're all mothers because my mother if I

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
can be you know myself but if

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
he threw me up against this wall he could have the front

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
of

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
everyone we may

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
need a refill in the magic of as this bears just

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
skyrocketed. The first is that you know you're

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
wealthy and you aren't very good at learning. Oh we need a lesson and help

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
me interest we desperately

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
need to have that and like

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
a queer woman you have like different strategies for different types of folks and I definitely do.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Yeah definitely are basic you know with men I have

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.000
no game

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
with men I'm just like. Let's do

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
it and that usually works right. Yeah he said he does not know

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
but I find that men

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
are generally easier but with men I never know when they're interested in me. I'm just like.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
You really have to spell it out like spell literally you have to put it on a fine to be

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
like that and

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
that's when I'll be like OK with women.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Women are complicated little creatures is not true that men are simple but it's true it's

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
true like women have to have game and so

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I try to play the long game and just like years about

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
your lawn. Very

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
well you know I'm like all about the romance and the

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
little surprises let's do some nice things and let's go walk through this park

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
and oh

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
yes the women's bottoms are here for

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
a paranoid outing

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Now

for those looking at the US haven't is a mighty has got to hold a

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
thousand Yes it is a word that gives our saddles.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
If you

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
could read and write a lot of erotica. She did no writing I would have

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
to bring that up. No you don't write for

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
me it is to make you think it's only imagine that you're

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
amazing at it because I am amazing at

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000

a

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
LOL when I say

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000

mean you're not there for the that you're there for like how he uses

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
it right and so that's where I spend my creative

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
actually

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Watterson like erotica tropes you could like do without. Oh

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Not

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
that I always hate unrealistic slick physically unrealistic

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
sex scenes like that to this day I'll never forget I read a submission once for an erotic anthology

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
and a man was on a an escalator going up and he was fucking a woman on the step

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.000
above him on

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
the escalator you were lying and think about it and I really did

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
long you were just shown the entire link of

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Roxie

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Foster which sounds very uncomfortable.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Depends on how I

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
use it a little high on

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
that note to

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
self

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
and then you got me here we got a raw puppy all

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
you want we are two parks that go on forever Didn't our producers had

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.000
a

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:54.000
rapid fire.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
I think it's time for a little thing we call a drunken

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
debate. So it's

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
not going to base if you don't know Logan like to play.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
We throw a bunch of random items into a bowl this time we solicited answers

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
from Twitter so these are all

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Twitter suggest I'll put aside actions that are going to be too random correct to

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
really to mount two minutes each even though I am been to the game I have

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
lost every round.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
most part most women don't want to wear heels because it's not uncomfortable literally no one has

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
somehow managed to like capture like a comfortable heel situation there are

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
all manner of trouble and true this is not true and oh what you

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000

invisible. Let me tell you about all the conversations you read here

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
not all the business plans you can overhear all the friendship plans you can

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
overhear not is on its heels used to be. There are women who enjoy them you can walk in them if you can't walk in the you don't

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
have to walk in them right out of my butt and then that would mean that you

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.000
put up

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000

you in the power of invisibility right Roxanne we're going to be easy to put down a verdict.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Well I appreciate the look of a woman in a good heel. But

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
incontrovertibly a racy one

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
just the right time

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000

for how many women here use diva good question.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Well maybe five maybe Who are those who don't know a Diva Cup is like the alternative

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
version of a tampon or Pad but it's a Cup It's a cup if you insert and badges

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
up and you have to take out in public.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Roxanne

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
particular piece.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.000
A few minutes on

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
the clock. I'm not going to go. All right we're going to talk about even listen

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
to how kind of annoying

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
it underwhelming how much women are like afraid to even buy tampons and pads

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Can I live a pretty I'm an adult

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
but the diva thing the Diva Cup.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
You only need to buy like not as often as a fucking tampon

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
or con It costs way less money super environmentally friendly

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
and

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
like I know like a white feminists have like.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Put a monopoly on like being in tune with your period hassling you

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000

that it's in the bag it's like a

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
plant that's all the hard serving. I mean many are going

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
OK I believe if you follow the old way then you already know this rant because I went on it a while

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
ago but I believe that hyenas get a bad rap because of the Lion

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
King week they were assholes in a movie.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
They was trying to kill Simba baby

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Simba in the wild is like you know

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
under scar control they can think for themselves you know whatever and they were just like whatever.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
OK hyenas not that you would want to pet hyena they're very vicious.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
You know whatever whining is the first ever saw America really what did you think of pine

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
is that the sound was like

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
I'm like well I was like all the all so Michael B.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Goldberg

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Pinus down a leg would be over that would be a mag full stop. So why do you wanna buy laughing

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.000
I'm buying

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000
rounds for hyenas because they live in a matriarchal society.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
I don't know let me tell you about hyenas sign right. I mean that money is

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
oh the women the women the females the women whatever their larger than

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
the males are typically doesn't happen in any species the female they they run

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
shit they ran shit hyenas have developed what is called a.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Pseudo penis. Go on.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000
OK It's like it's basically like in in a long gated quick right.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
And this is due to high levels of testosterone. I have I really like animals. OK

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
I like animals alas a radical I am is but they have such high levels of

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
testosterone that they basically

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000
like they have like a fake penis right in the middle when it comes time to mate.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
They they have to submit to them like instantly even if there's a male that's bigger than the female they

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
submit doesn't match.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
All the way and already already

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
been know

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
the anatomy of the I think this in a stallion

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
is such that they're basically right proof right. So

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
like they're animals and no I'm sorry just hang in there with me there are some animals

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
like ducks ducks are heartless

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000
rapists they are the dolphins right there's a rabbit in the animal

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
kingdom not in the hyenas though. Here's

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
why because they also have pseudo Rotem pseudo

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
testes that like they have to get in a certain position for for the male to copulate with them.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Listen if that is not consistent.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.000
I don't know what

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
is yet to be like OK I approve of you physically fine.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
I approve of like your submission than I have to do

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
whom I don't know what position they have to get in with if that happens but they have to make an effort for

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
any copulation to happen otherwise then I mean they also

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Also if the sex is wack they attack him.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:45.000
So

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
they have to have all the sexual power and so like their entire society is

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
based on women with the when the one has a want to get their own that's it.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
That was a journey.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000
I have my high. It would be like my right.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000
OK. Well I can't beat the

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
game but I'm going to buy a round for my husband which one.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Channing

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Tatum

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
he's just so great for she's the

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
man all the way for

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
people that love the economy

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
and yet like in the preview the trailer

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
for Magic Mike when he's like holding the steel

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000
rod sparks or ejaculate ing from the because

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
he's making furniture because that's his true

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
dream is the actual plot as many I've seen

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
it was actually physically The There's no plot of Magic Mike the plot is that men take

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.000
off their

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
clothes and so everything else bang bang. Everything else

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
is just time until men take off their clothes but Channing is just so happy all

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
the time and he has a net zero it's just

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
like one of

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
my teeth into it and then he sends emails with a lot of exclamation

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
points as the Sony leaked taught us.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I love this you appreciate a man I

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
do I appreciate a lot about him. Luke and his thighs and his abdomen

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
and his he's just face he's like a blank slate and we just project our desire

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000
on to him and he amplifies it with his greatness.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
I feel like you're writing erotica right now you know I love him.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:38.000
It's

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
like I'm really actually weird how much I love chatting and I'm really lucky that I'm

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
supported in this place and

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
I can tell you that.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
OK so I'm going to buy a round for my

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Oh and for Tracy.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Crazy does this thing

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
on Twitter calling up

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
emotionally to do the same. Maybe

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
this thing on Twitter called Just one thing and it's like

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
her little hash tag

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000
and I feel like for the longest time I just one thing was call a

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
psychiatrist but I couldn't call psych I just thought calling a therapist because most people are like

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
you have to have. The therapy to do the drugs but I was like No I mean the drugs to do

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
this very P.S. if you would like a long

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
