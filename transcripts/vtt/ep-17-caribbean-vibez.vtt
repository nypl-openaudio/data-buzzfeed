00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey everyone I'm havin Tracy and welcome to another round of heaven

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
J.C. and I love that if

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
you take it like we did the ladies.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
right you see what we got today. Oh my gosh I am so excited to have

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
like someone who I hope will quit her actual job just about in my life coach Yes absolutely

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
they would me from my seat because I needed it so so that our friend

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and coworker if they can reach Israel is he or she is the head. Editor

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of fuzzy news apps and to them Are you going to be here in Ireland.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yet she will think your entire life

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
hopefully

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we've been trying to figure out ways that we can like interview each other on the air and just kind of like

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
have random conversations about very random things not that that's not what we do anyway right.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So we came across a game called personality.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's essentially just like a game. Full of questions that you ask friends whoever

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you're playing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
with so the way this game works. Each card has a multiple choice question on it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and whoever they read the question.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And they read all the answers and their opponent has to guess how the reader

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.000
would

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
answer. Yeah. So this is all about how well do I know Tracy unravel the stories you know me write. I feel like

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the premise of this game is

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
great

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
question where did you know I wrote

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it because they're like. If you could travel back in time.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Tell me that question that I want to be well for some time now right back.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If you could go back in sand where would you go. Yeah and then where maybe maybe a

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.000
month

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
ago my little black comedian has a joke about that yet and I mean how

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
could they have not heard. Anyway. Like it was written by like the worst guy in H.R. like Toby from the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
office get to know each other good do like the idea that.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Yeah I love getting to know you can you can rule. All

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
right first question oh my gosh I'm nervous. This doesn't go well for me to badly you ask me questions

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
on air. I mean. OK I lose my knowledge of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the losing the way to lose everything that I lose.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
OK if I could be completely free of one of the following emotions which would I choose

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and why a impatience be anxiety

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
see jealousy deep insecurity the intolerance.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Of the like you kind of enjoy the and intolerance. I'm joking Wow You

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
know I mean I don't tolerate a lot so you know I am.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I don't

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
know if I like the obvious answer things I do you know being naming being right you know me

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
well you know me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
well you got him. All right.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Which of the following a scandal of what I like to get the inside scoop on life and why.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky's relationship. O.J. Simpson's trial.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Rupert Murdoch news groups. Wiretapping of celebrities.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Or Bernie Madoff's downfall. OK. Definitely

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
not going to but.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Oh gee a harmonic couple weeks key.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
There's definitely some insight off of the last in both of those stories. I'm going to go with Lewinsky.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It was the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
O.J. Yes because here's my thinking about Jay

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I do not think that he physically committed the crime I got

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that I did he had somebody do it for

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
him. Let's now watch and I don't know you well I got to have did it was I think the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
way. Oh my god the glove didn't fit though did the glove.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I am learning a lot

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
about you know the saying

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I have a fact because you know I'll and like to cry now you are. Lassalle the best

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
documentary about this guy who was probably I think he was probably a serial killer.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He's the guy who did it. O.J. the involved. He had this guy do it that's what I think anyway.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
OK Wow I'm trying to learn a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
lot

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
today. All right next

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
question I have the power to rid the world of one of the following which what I choose and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
why parking meters pimples

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
flies fad diets or

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
glitter just once on the like the thing that you can get rid of in the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.000
world glitter

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and parking meters and temples. I feel like I'm pretty strong inside. I'm gonna say

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
last night why were necessary part of our ecosystem

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
they're annoying. True but like I want to get rid of them the right answers

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
fad diets bad diets are

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
so trash they are trash and like just the way we think about our bodies is trash and

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
my mother all burn it down for a little while my mom and brother were doing the cabbage soup diet

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
what what is that it is it's bad it's where you eat cabbage soup like

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Aldous like in time and like there are certain days where you can have like certain fruits or like certain whatever isn't one day you

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
can have like a steak. Listen. So I was like very very against anybody doing with

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that rabbit I'm like you know what I'm your daughter a

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
levy let me do this with you and she was like Will. I attempted.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The first day. As such attitude such as who probably

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
has that we hungry Yeah. You already

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
know cabbage makes you gassy

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it's all right so when

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
day when they are a member when it was my last day on this diet when they would

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
baked potato day you would have a big ass baked potato in addition to like your yeah but

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I mean we got like really really big baking potatoes

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and have I'M time at like this the butter and like the salt and like

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the pepper it felt like a full steak dinner just me and this potato.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I ate every inch

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of this. Say it out me even this even in that the in that month. My mother

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
was like you know what we're done with the least I can not take you no way to look

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
over then it's not me she didn't do it because she wouldn't have a son I got on her nerves so much. Oh so hungry.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
She's like I'm not doing it with you anymore. I recently learned you thing

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is where you try to live off

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
just you know I thought they were like you

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
know cleansing and then like other stuff so they don't need anything it is just you.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
You literally cannot do that like this is not how the human body

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
works at last I'm OK. Which of the following trips. What I found

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the most challenging and why a stay in a nudist camp bus

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
trip across India a camel ride across the desert in Oregon as holiday on

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a cruise ship or camping with nothing but a backpack in the woods

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
definitely camping Absolutely. Shit why. Why would you who do the wall

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
entirely like when you pretend to be home. There is a building that we can go inside

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of like why would I live in a first world country not use air

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
conditioning what I'm

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
havin a shitty week trying to sleep on an air mattress that has a leak in it I cannot imagine sleeping on

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
the right way

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but you know I know you well

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
geez trees I feel like I got to know you a little better. You know that

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
already series and

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
also

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
an update on who wants to date a trace the late that were

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
really renamed as of two seconds ago. So

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
we're still getting some some intrigue. What is a place without me trying

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
to be absent missing that one from a twenty four year

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
old girl

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
though I was

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
rather. Going to pass on that when like I'm old enough to

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.000
have changed his.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Diapered on he was that's not how you should approach the people what we don't talk

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
about

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but you talk to me every day you are in secret thirty two year old you know this

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is true see. But there are some of us out there but I'm saying you know

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I guess I have no confirmation that this one is one of you but yeah

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it's still going we're slowly collecting in trees and there's one and then I was kind of like

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Blue oh

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
OK maybe try to keep them as local as possible. We're not flying anybody up

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
here or out of fear or anything if you or someone that you know you think they

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
would be a good fit for me. Can't believe we're doing

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
this then them a picture in a short blurb explaining why we should

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
be together

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
badly. For I was dating

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
game in my life and those I lie. I got three

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
more years I don't not happen

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and it's not that serious and it really it really

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is since you left and another around at the speed that I'm

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
a

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
few weeks ago we asked for your call and responses to the question What are some of

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the wildest microaggression experience in the workplace in Iran the

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
many there are so many. They're like you know they made me laugh but also really

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
say hello or says I like Oh. I thought oh my God I'm

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
not going to say that they disagree.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
They may be hilarious that no I don't want a little bad but it's like the thing where you like the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
laugh in the Gazette at them like you know I mean yeah that's a layer that.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
OK so here are just a few of some of the call and

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
responses.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
this story kind of has multiple layers of what the fuck the funniest migration

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that's happened to me at work I'm at the copier and. Or a white male coworker walks

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
up to me and begins sounding off all of these tasks that I am to finish before in the

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
day during that moment when I'm looking at

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
him. But I realize that he things on the black.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So I finish what I'm doing and I walk away while he's still talking so that he realizes that

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I don't work at the

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
end just to give you a background story. I'm

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
originally from

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Ethiopia what couple coworkers and I are talking about one of

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
our colleagues about to have a baby she turns around to

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
me and goes I made so much breast

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
milk all the people in your country who the hell

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
am I going to go to when the person but it to me is our H.R.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:01.000
director.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But then again I'm like a level pretty sort

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
of the things that aren't

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
running down here in this particular area is

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that why people want

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to make these jokes. I

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
mean they don't make

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
corny like

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
this go in on the

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
negative and I want

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
to but I'm a lot of

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
them when I was in

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
college delivery. And a

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
transaction tell them the price they put them on you might

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
argue and they change back in transaction

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
people when I got there and I told them the price they want to give me the money.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
They don't have a piece of good they want to put their child. On top

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
of pizza box and which sometimes slipped off the floor because

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
of working in investment banking a

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
large bank that's headquartered in the south will just leave it at that. So I'm in a meeting

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and someone is giving a presentation and they're in their presentation and they were saying

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
oh this this thing happened before the war and then they

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
say the War of Northern Aggression

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that. And then everyone else in the meeting

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
just cracked up and I'm just like using the

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
context clues smart enough to

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
gather that this is a room full of people who

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
are I'm not a slave and everyone is laughing

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and no one sees why this would be offensive to

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
me and I'm also you know everything

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
from oh you look so pretty and. You speak English really

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
well this past week I just got to where you were originally from which

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
is like I mean I was born in this country but I'm from

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Seattle for some reason my ethnicity came up at work one day unexplained.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I was half Chinese. My whiter than a ghost colleague was so

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
unbelievably confused because I guess she'd been reading me as

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
white kept saying things like no you're not that's not true and then she

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
said but I have lots of Asian friends and you don't look anything like that and

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I literally had to explain to her

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
like I'm in the airport and normally I wear my hair in

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
twits or and on this particular day I always wear my hair in or for

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
another supervisor outside of our office he

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
was towards me and says Hey let's fix this mess and put his hand in my

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
hair and I had to sit there stone faced because you are right because if

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
it had been under any other circumstances he was our custom fuck

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
out of the grave matter recently came out. Repeat.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
In the airwaves. I was wearing my hair really short.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So this woman comes into my cubicle area.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
She's commenting on my hair and how she likes it and then she goes on

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to say you like my little peek. I looks nothing

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
like Whoopi just was amazing and brilliant and beautiful.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I throw out in the same thing but we look nothing alike like it didn't make any

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
sense without a quarter out on peepers radio people

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.000
are

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
crazy table when somebody asks me

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
hey are you going to bring to the public and then some bank he

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
decides she wants to enter Jack's answer for

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
me to like Oh. She can bring some fried chicken instances

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or some syrup. Excuse

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
me this year I didn't go to that for

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
more than freaking proving which owing Ababil to a thing or

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
they say they don't work for speciated not to go. Boss

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
comes in he asked everyone I mean a loon to me only in the room with

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
blacks how you know you today normal

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
day comes to me. Good I am strong and he eight years

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
old not a little boy we can go out there and get some candy

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I look around I pause as he tossed

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
to me he's looking straight at me I don't I don't understand what do I have to

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
go out and catch Candy I'm a grown ass man I don't think I need to go out and catch came in

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.000
a

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
child and why do I have to go I think it's Cammy of him OK great because I'm black.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I guess that to them later. OK yeah if you know where my soul

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
every time I look at him that's my

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
microaggression Yeah we're praying for you

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I can't even go to work without being in.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Against Racism you know these are places from the way I go to learn about being

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
hey Christ

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
treats us like this again. So thank you all so

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
much for responding to that question. Our next question for like the month or whenever

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we decide to put it out is as you know Northwest is going to be a

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
big sister. If we have any baby listeners out there this one's for

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
you shout out to all the kids. We probably should we listen to yeah

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I know. But we want to know. Do you have any advice for Northwest about being an

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
older sibling in these tips that come from the children in your life. Yes Now your kids I

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
mean I was occasions are you are under ten.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Yet I don't want any adult opinions. A reminder I call a number is five to

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
zero two rounds that's five to zero to seven six eight six three

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
seven or you can e-mail us of voice memo or some sort of voice

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
recording to another round of Buzz Feed dot com and with the most typically found that

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
or sound quality wise we prefer those but if you can't do that show. This

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
is a

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
precursor to see the segment I'm dying to do which is baby talk

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
show talk show.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Saying and now be embedded these

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:25.000
day. I would love that.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.000
We

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
are unbelievably excited to have Stacy Marie Ishmael on the podcast. Every time I see

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
her name I want to pronounce it the Ethiopian way

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
smile on

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
my stationery is the head of the news apps multiple

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
apps launching your own hard busy working but if you guys want to check out

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
the news app go to buzzy dot com slash news app and all that's their damn right will tell you everything

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
you need to know about the world right now. Yes All right so stationary What do you do and why.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Would I do.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
My responsibility at Buzz Feed is to make sure that we are. Doing

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
news on mobile in the best possible way for audiences whatever devices are on whatever platforms

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
are on whatever country they're

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
in why do I do it I like

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
challenges and I've never said my mobile is

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
a hard I love news man I like OK I

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
don't necessarily like waiting over four o'clock in the morning. I know things

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
but it's really fun and I get to work with fantastic people. I mean I think this

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
is a really interesting position because you have to do both like the product dev

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
side and the like editorial news side. I mean the good news is I don't have to

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
code because obviously I mean everyone but you're

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
right that's a

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
lot to oversee and like to feel that like a lot of people spend their life time specializing right.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I don't understand why everyone in my

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
profile you write the actually who has that kind of

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
time it's super fun to be in a position where half the time you have no idea what you're

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
doing the other half the time you kind of think you know what you're doing we're not exactly sure what it is up to try and

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
see what happens. That's my night so you know I

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
mean it's a super

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
fun. So let's backtrack a little since not enough people are profiling

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
when you're relying on your I'm going to take that on like babies

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
the same way like where not everybody everybody is

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
listening to your actions like you're like why do you feel like you're Welsh. OK so I'm

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
not sure the story.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I grew up in Trinidad so turned on to go the country but turned on the island and

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I lived on till I was like seventeen and then I was like I need to get

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
really small. And I want to see other things the world so I decided like what is the

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
for this place that I could possibly go like let's move to France.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Let me show you the and seventeen ages of the in France my mother was not impressed with me but

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
also

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
surprised. In theory I went for

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
school I was studying like

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
linguistics and really really grim psychology like if you've never read. I'm.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So you don't read this but there was there was a book a moment like my third day in the country and it was like OK now

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
we're going to talk about the theory of suicide of

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
like my good luck.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I mean that's not going to sing like that I would like but I don't know if I would if my dude named Eric

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I'm you know that's my jihadi and

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
there's like that accomplish two things mayors like I

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
don't want to live in

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
France and I probably don't want to study psychology instead moved to

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
London at the time I'm like you know what I'm really interested

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and feel like in

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
retrospect who sees a nod somebody should

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
be talking on the shoulder but I know what was it like being black in all those

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
different places. Well I didn't know I was black. So I

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
moved out of trying to you know yeah like coming from a rock pop you know I mean I

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
in the Caribbean

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I'm what would be called red in the island of mixed ancestry. I

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
like to say I'm of ethnically ambiguous origin and then I moved to London there like so

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
you should join the black and minority ethnic society I'm like

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
wow yeah sure you know I remember that

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I called a ruckus. I call it right. It's a thing I love the

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
show so I go you know I'm an undergrad

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
and there's the African Caribbean society like this is cool but in the

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
year that I was getting into undergrad there were a couple of other students in the Caribbean one of

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
whom you would think was Chinese like one of whom you would think was Indian one of you think was

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
like Syrian Yeah because that's what the Caribbean is Iraq up at the back for can criticize anything in

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.000
half the rooms

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
like Suma here. It's not awkward at

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
all and so we decided

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
that we were going to create the Caribbean vibes a society like a splinter group.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
You still vibe with with the right we

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
have there may have you know a palm tree in the logo it was

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
like you know like I called it and it was terrible and really it's by.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
But it was really interesting because the first time I ran smack into being assigned an

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
identity that I hadn't given to myself it was particularly

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
interesting for you know because I look more like I could belong to the African Caribbean society than the other

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
people that I rocked up with

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and I remember a particularly interesting meeting with the student

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
union which is sort of like you know student government in U.K. terms having to explain

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
like how islands are different we don't necessarily have

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
the same commonalities like an entire continent on a couple of islands.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
So you know those are fun times when I first woke up in class people were surprised.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Like I am Hello mouthy right now it was like a me

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
talking and I

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
would run for things in student government and get really involved as you don't call as I can people be like.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
But your

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
persona haven't happened.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Soft bigotry of low expectations are right on like interesting interesting and my favorite

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
the anecdote I always tell and will never forget is I met and there was a like a Japanese girl in one of

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
my classes and she's like where you from the Caribbean I could see like the blackness of the state like I was in even a region

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
that

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
registered and so trying to explain in conceptualizing like you know what kind of native

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Venezuela are in the Caribbean ocean.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So do you speak for Con Man United.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
That's why

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
my love I believe I know the answer you seek Asian let

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
me let me know that if you re going to filling in someone

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
else but it was you know it was a reminder that you know I'm from the small asylum but I still know a

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
reasonable amount about the world maybe because I'm from inside the little island but it was it was really just

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
running smack into perceptions of myself that had that were being imposed on me that I didn't I

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
wasn't exposed to before and it was weird

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
and so when you're doing all this hiring for like your news team or just like all the

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
projects you're part of like how do you think about the people you're bringing

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
in. Well you also tweet a lot

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
about. They like that so I think that's where

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.000
my

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
rants about hiring volume five. So I'm going to

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
use a soccer. Plus football analogy here

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
because one of the things I think about is how do you create a team

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
that wants to be a team and not just a collection of superstars. You know so it's like Real Madrid

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
versus Basel where both of you know it's kind of like there are people on who play festival so who

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
are individual geniuses. But collectively

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
like it's a different level right and I try very hard to make

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
sure that each individual person I'm hiring has unique

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
strengths but are A and crucially not an asshole and be like

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
additive to the team so they're bringing something that the team lacks but they're also

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
bringing themselves as a person and identity. Who's going to like make the entire team

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
better

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
and you know it is so so important not just to assume that

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
because you come from a minority you have no like biases. I think everybody

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
has implicit and explicit things that were just like you know and sometimes we

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
don't interrogate like where those reservations are coming

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
from and so that's like that's another thing I'm really sensitive to which is that I don't want

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
to you know be lazy about my hiring because I'm like I'm brown I'll make more evolved decisions or

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I'm a woman only more involve decisions like

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I'm like not true I'm a mom I disagree.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And so I try to be really really thoughtful and I try to have systems in place to like check any implicit biases that

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I might have in every stage of my hair and process. What do you think are them like the

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
most I don't know

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
like the things people are doing wrong in the hiring like the most egregious thing where just one

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
begin on your end on the higher end and the application

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
and there are a couple things that are really consistent one is. People don't know that when somebody posts a

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
job description. What they're trying to do is solve a specific problem rather trying

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
to find skills that their team doesn't have the company doesn't have and really what they're asking

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
for when you're applying is. How can you help me solve this problem not how are you like the most

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
amazing creature that ever walked the earth. So I'll get tons of cover letters that are like I am exceptionally well to

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
this position because I have a

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
degree like cool. What do you know about what

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I'm trying to

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
do and how can you articulate That's right. One of the things that definitely bothers me and is very

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
gendered is the way women present their accomplishments real women

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
prisoner complex money latter on the IRA So I'll give you three

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
examples. Two of the people on my team are trying to like so we're hiring in London New York

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
and L.A. and one of the we want team to set up a system where like

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
for interview somebody could say hey I would like a thirty minute slot to talk to you are like a sixty minute slot to

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
talk to every single dude sixty

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Minutes. Why every single one thirty

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
minutes and they were sent the same email

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
and went for all the time

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
like one example. Another example is that when it comes to talking about

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
their achievements. You know and like broad generalisations a lot of the series of scene from

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
women with extremely impressive histories will say things like

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I contributed to more i really helped with or you know like my team did as

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
opposed to like I led this project that was amazing. Like I built this thing from scratch and all the dudes who might have

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
been you know associates or whatever I was like because of me single

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
handedly all by myself in the back to the mind what

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I was like What is the social a vision process that we go to where we have we're taught to

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
like shrink from the things that we have achieved on it from

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
the D.L.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
girl Patrick the

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
no we can't go make the film we see it's

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
good you can have the fish on

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
the successful THE you for the

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
last and then the third is like the follow up. So if I then.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Thoughtfully worded rejection email to a dude my guy you know visibly It's like

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
you're making a mistake.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Oh my God or like Harold actually said

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Oh I

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
think not

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
only did this person essentially insinuates that I had no idea what I was doing done like send an

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
email to

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Ben the other soul is not

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
God like you know I really

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
think only my really in your my home in

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
the man I can currently have you had a similar experience for us right. I

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
was hiring and he was it's like it was immediate within like the first day he

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
got the ball that was all the applications I got there be people who are like who had

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
incredible resumes and be super self-effacing and like I'm like Girl you're great right and

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
then dude's who had like nothing in there as me like brother

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
and I are you

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
know. Yeah I'm with him

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
and everything to me and this is like what I mean one of many reasons that I wanted to have you want to

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
show because I know it is what I thought it was in him but see this I think this is

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
like legitimately the first time that I worked a job where there were like black women like

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
in charge of

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
shit yeah laughs I mean like yeah I don't want to do that until to black women who

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
like get to hire people that whole I being new to my own

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
voice in me. Typically like my background as far as office work goes on like the

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
administrative person so I like you know I'm not looped in meetings

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
and so I've never had any physical visual examples

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
of black women or even brown women that young women of brown

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
women empowered to know that first of all like it's even possible. You know what I mean.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
And then like

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
how to navigate these spaces when it comes to like having

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
to negotiate for things in the workplace and like when you're talking about like how women present

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
their accomplishments. That's a thing as I literally do not know how to do you know what I mean like

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
you're talking to people have to be like Hey remind him that you're the

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
shit if you were. And they would expect you to say and I mean if it's something that I have

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
to be so conscious of doing. You know there's a saying which has become increasingly popular which is you

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
know you can't be what you can't see and it's just it's just so important just the

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
mass site of a woman who looks like you doing things that you aspire to yeah

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
it's kind of like transformational the cellular

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
level that is so macho that's been going around with

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
my friends is carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Oh my god that's how we live and you can.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Says the most important impact I think of everything that you have to go.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
For brown women who has gone through life working jobs where she

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
has seen no representation of herself in positions that she may want one day but she doesn't know if she

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
can like attain it if she's like worth it or anything like what tips would you give

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
that woman as far as like how to secure these positions just like

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I don't know what the general advocating for years yeah. There you go there you go.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I mean before any of that is know why you want it right. So

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
whenever you're thinking about like I want to be doing this is it because other people are doing it is because other people say you should be

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
doing is this something that you know like fundamentally inside something that you want to

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
do so last week Misty Copeland was you know recognized for her

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
considerable Belasik talents and she became the first black

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
female principal soloist falling down so

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
that you know I got all the I'll just

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
let the American like Valley it is a she was quoted by The New York Times

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
as

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
saying one of the things that she you know was worried about is that if she didn't get to that promotion.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
People there wouldn't be another ballerina like her generation and they would you know and

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
nobody would be there to inspire young black girls who wanted to be bullied ounces. They would

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
never see somebody who looked like them on the

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
stage what she struck out was really interesting which is that sometimes you feel like you have

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
to do things. That you don't even want to just so other

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
people from which this is

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
loosely you go to like a lot of conferences and panels Yeah you know

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
it's like that emotional labor of representing

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
all this is the number one reason I do panels that you like is something

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
that was happening when he was on the chair right like never being able to just be like that guy and the kind I'm talking about

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
is kind to me I think one thousand nine hundred eighty.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
This was the counter. Yeah right

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
off that. Yeah. When you are the only one of your THE FIRST ONE TO you're one of very few you sort of feel like I got to do this thing

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.000
that I bring my A

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
game like everybody else and they

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
was like you're you know a standard is being satins like maybe the next time somebody who sees somebody looks like you they be like

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
oh yeah we should give them a chance because that other one was all the really good

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
and so knowing what your motivations are super important and

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
then there was almost always a community that you can find enjoying that will support

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
you and that I think is something superimportant like even if you feel like it's only you. You know like

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
when I

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
was vivre own person in my philosophy class was

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
like there must be other people in the bank and you you go and you find

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
them and like sometimes in the lab or in the reading the same booking just like happened as a

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
narrative like are you in that other Jews are

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
always talk about pleasing the

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
thing you have to be willing to be vulnerable which is sometimes at odds with having like a path

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
to be about us all the

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
time where those things are really in contradiction and then remembering that this is

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
hard right this is hard like being the under represented under represented person

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
being the being the minority being from the person from a background not like

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
anybody else's you run into things the micro Gresham's like

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
the like the invisible the code of conduct and nobody told you about the rules that everybody else is playing by that you're

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
not privy to this is hard and is exhausting and it will stress you out and that is a

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
totally legitimate response and you have to not be so hard on yourself when you're like am I doing

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
everything wrong like I don't understand why is it so hard it is hard because it is hard and not because you are like

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
not good at

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
the crash. I don't have to worry about our

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Rio I feel like

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
every single woman I know of Buzz Feed looks to you as a mentor.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Well if you're not that much by absolutely

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
everybody but you feel

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
like you have had mentors or you have mentors in your life now.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I definitely have sought them out you know I mean not in the like will you be my

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
mental mentor. Yeah and I am I you know I like

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
look at how amazing you are like I get to work with you

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
the ever before it was about me when I was like the being

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
of the Financial Times over seven hundred years

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
including the well I'm not so much now are they so funny I don't

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
mean that I mean to make this kind of I know I'm so I think you know I think it's

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
really important not to think of a mentor as somebody who you see as being like on a different level as you but somebody

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
with different experiences from you who might be doing something completely

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
different and the path of them entering is super important and different from just like supporting each other

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
because you need a support network but you also need people who call you on your shit. Yeah.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
You could have done that better yet. Here's how you can have a lot situation next time.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Now let's go for a

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:19.000
drink get the the list please never leave.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Obviously

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
we could is hard for you forever and just like let you teach us how the world

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
had how to do being a black girl please I

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
will any time the students will

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
go down like a nice little Abby honestly I tell you Jim It's flowing

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
in a few pew pew pew pew.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Oh it was. So in our last

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
episode when we had crossed the line. I saw Peter people were angry that we didn't ask her

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.000
about

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
coral I was like I realize you were so wedded to that

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
question that we will never make that mistake the sorrow.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
They see Mary you know how do you feel about. So I have this hierarchy of awful

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
creatures feeling like at the

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
top in terms of like worst most awful I will move like rats.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000

I'm I mean I

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
know.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
It's one of those things I realize like the return on investment of my hearing I was negative because I think like

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
a thousand million hours. He blew it up to me

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
so is very soothing and I'll bring you home from GOD HE'S

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
A Do I want to remain to be refrigerated Yes because there are no preservatives in my

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I didn't look around for the quick yes just so much I don't

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
know that.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I did not think we'd get better

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
and. What are some fruits you'd rather have in

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
the Caribbean than in America

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
mangoes and knew you were going to see me you know I mean I think there is no other

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
fruit that's true you're right. We don't think about their fruit so it's become a

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
god so you are a dance hall D.J. in a former life who tell you some

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
research I waste Sinestro what that

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
was the name but was it repeated it was the just an extra

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
because I'm left

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
handed and I'm a super nerd and like the Latin for left handed

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.000
is

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Sinestro my God but I don't see this issue and it's a sin because you know

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
while I could not just

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
like coming out the Jason my head

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
my favorite genre of your tweets are like. You complaining about

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
the anthology didn't have a Sean Paul and the better I mean I'm

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
not acceptable if I had gone like you had some good

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
songs by the two thousand and you're

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
livin

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
my goodness favorite song to wind.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Who what year. Let me in the year of your preference. So I never actually liked so

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
the whole Does he wind genre was just too

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
violent for me is a lie a lie you like it like you will stab and situated

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
in the sun and now I know why you're not really my

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
scene in about a couple of years I have like I

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
have feelings about Marshall Manzano. But I really like the soca song that he came up with

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
called the happiest man alive because it just has it's

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
really like this one kind of uptempo But as with all so comedic there like

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
to see you doing the slow wind. Or you

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:06.000
actually like John and the people at the B.B.C. on the moon.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
If you like but are

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
you going to be a foreigner like somebody through

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
the this is

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000

even though I would love to continue documentation regret

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
ever and we need to buy this around because people need some drinks. OK.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I'm going to buy around for him even though you guys are known him but let me tell you all Osama is about America.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
So

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
America went to this like really like bougie private school in

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Boston or in Massachusetts not in Boston proper and it's like

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
the fancy private schools where like Mitt Romney's children probably go over some shit but he

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
went there on scholarship and after he graduated college he went back because he just saw

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
so many problems and how it was done and like just all this shit need to be

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
fixed every institution I've been a part of like that is like

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
fuck y'all listening on the blood line like I'm having even I think more you never see me ever again good

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
luck to you say what he was

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
saying it wasn't even just that. Like he's good for the job because he's

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
great but like someone has to do it he has like this.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
African-American studies class that he's introduced to this

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
white ass school and I'm like I'm not just saying that because He added My Conny essay

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
to this little bit.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
also he is leaving this is his last year there and I think

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
it's so

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
hard to know when to leave a place. Listen Or

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
like when to know your energy is just like being sucked out. So he's leaving

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
because he's unhappy there. It's just hit a wall with like how much work he can do. Yeah like his

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
classes poppin like they're now like oh we need to have these classes like there's you know like he's doing well

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
but like there's only so much you can give of yourself to institutions

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
like this loser like doesn't drink they never lie when he said. You know all these niggas trying

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
to drain me of my energy. Well actually Drake has lied you know like that right.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
He said I like my girl B.T.W.. That bitch where

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Anyway it's around for him but around for like everyone was like I don't have to be a part of

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
this like I do my own cool dope shit right. I don't need your cosign I don't need to do like

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Yes sometimes like the analogy that I always use in a situation is. If feels like I'm pushing against a brick

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
wall big xylene I'm going to move and I'm going to stay here and like break my elbow which I needed to

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
move or I can go to some else. Yeah. A real fire Mecca.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I got enemies got a lot of enemies got a lot of people trying to train me and it's been a

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
change trying to change the way it from a new succulent a kid it

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
greatly and they

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
go about around

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
forty

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
buying around for the entire air bad boy family

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
nineteen nine before the two thousand.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And when one to the Golden

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Age an era of bad boy. Yeah.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
So last week the BT or so on in they did a bad boys review.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Yeah me and I have never been so

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
dry by

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
the. Left dad

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
was on thank you didn't Bobby you know Mays came out rapping off about

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.000
big

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
shiny mirrored room that they were in with one video. Momentum

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000
of problems faced with on stage when the well came out and then in the middle

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
of all this the floor

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
opens up and up levitate Kimberly Jonas I thought

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
OK a little Kim

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
left I was at work there was like a small team of us that were covering to be feel

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
that covering the beads you were a real country

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
sorry I'm excited because I had

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
that

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
many injury it was just got up all around the room was

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
like a magnet in the

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
face of the home because they only seem on the mark to deny

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I called two zero zero zero. Welcome you

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000

and I mean this was in like remakes is where X. will remake No I like

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
that sound like completely different song so I reread and

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
married a black hat an entire remakes album. Well

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
and I'm thinking maybe now because you know I mean

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
the music was so good also

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
faith in Merkin were on the same stage with the reconciliation like it's either live with you

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
happy and now like I want to listen to nothing but bad boy for that so

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
far and do a

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000
