he rest in peace and a limb is a bullet he was not actually a goldfish.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
OK but he was a racist.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I mean I'm hoping a change anyway will get into this or that and then for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the main course if you will we had allow it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000

only Adi Cornish N.P.R. News gotta say a little bit terrified. A

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
lot because she's incredible scene like interview like a million

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
people write like super important people were looking forward to that that are

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
terrified but focused on

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:45.000
whose

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
story

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.000
have

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and want to happen with them while I write letters and what happened with so this is the story of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
cornbread my races.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I guess the lookout the. Something I want

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to talk to me about COURT OK So the novel read was. As a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
beta known also as a sign me sighting fish right. My mother and I used

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to keep them all the time and we would get one day it will live its little better life I would

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that we would get another beta. All of them are special I don't want

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to sound like you should really just replacing pets.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They have and we loved each and every one of these Ok so I'm in college. And I wanted a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
pet we go to the store I see this beautiful beta and if you're not familiar with it is a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
very very pretty they come in with all these neat little iridescent jewel tones and got like these really

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
long since they kind of look like an evening gown like kind of wafting in the water it's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.000
very

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
pretty you guys can see it but I mean the sight. With her

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
for

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
real. But the male is a very aggressive. Yeah

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a Grammy to the point because you're right to the point that you can have two males in the same ball and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if you put a mirror up to the ball of a male he will puff up and try to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
attack his own reflection.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So they want to seriously. You know of course I did all the time when I was little because it's a cool

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
trick to show your friends but you really shouldn't do that it stresses that out probably kills them in the end maybe if you do it too much

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
from stress I like doesn't like ramming into the really aggressive.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I got a killer

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
things all the time so I said I'm the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
fish. And I'll just like this guy his name is cornbread don't know

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
why I just knew that his name was corn and take cornbread back to my dorm room.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I was living at the time I can't remember what year this was but my roommate was

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
definitely black and all like four of my friends on him were

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
also black so like they would come over you know I mean I had white friends too. I don't want to sound like I just didn't have any

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
why

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
friends but whenever my wife friends were over and they were like you know like in the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
blood he was cool he was still and he was pretty docile whatever but when I got next to the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ball or any other black person I mix with a bow he would flip out he would puff up

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
his gills and he like started like going at the side of the bowl in my when I was

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
feed him once. Upas i'm some of his food in the bow in like I let

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
my finger linger and finger linger.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I let my finger like kind of like hover above the water to see if you would ignore the food that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
he needs to eat to try and kill

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
my fingers stray from it but the thing and I'm like Dude do you not understand that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
as you need me to change

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
your wire. I love you like ice How do you how this happened he just treated me like like

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
all the bottom of the microcontroller testing was like black friend right friend you know

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I didn't do any official shows but I did

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
have made mental notes on them you know I mean it was a very

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
strained relationship but you know I just always as it was the day that he would come

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
around you know like both the man has admitted this in the nineteen fifties

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
anymore. You don't have to do this for me this

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is two thousand like I don't know three probably two thousand two thousand three is a new day is a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
new era. I need you to come around

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to the right that a great you say you want to do this

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
anymore. And so like I would at think there's a picture of this somewhere but I would write little

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
like inspirational quotes on index cards and I put it next to his

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
bowl all while left to go to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
class maybe just really wanted him to love me. So that I would have the love

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
mean I think once there was a Martin Luther King quote but the quote This sticks out to me the most There's

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
a song by guilt guy Herring called the Klan which is a really really good song. There's a line

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in it this is he who rats with the Klan is a devil and not a man so I wrote that annoy index

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
card and I put in next

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
so much thought it will show that it will help. So it's the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the last minute team and it was like OK I'm going to pull out the big this is I get

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
a fuck you don't get right

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
it

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000
with

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
the set

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
up stairs. So

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
never gave up on love and warm bread. Trying to get points rated to not be awful to me

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
pretty sure you had me

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
up until the date of the dead and here's how he

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
died. It was like a long weekend or something and my mom came to campus to get

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
me and it was chilly

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
outside and I had the headquarters both in on a window sill and the windows cracked.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now I maintain that my mother forgot to either close the window or move the ball she says it was

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
me I would never do that when the my mom.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Killed my fish and now you listen I know you guys has them say about this mom but we all

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
know the truth.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So get back to campus Corbridge did belly up frozen to death. I

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
was very upset. I was very very upset and I was like Man I feel like he was just put in the Marines.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
He was going to change his life but you know you just mow down in his prime and it was so

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
sad so I had demanded that we had an official funeral

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for cornbread mind God we

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
were the most annoying child I was

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
really. So we took the ball to the to the girls' bathroom we were in the stall.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And that's not saying whether you know you did

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
this as saying. Soon we'll be done with the troubles of the world by merely Jackson which

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I believe I was saying at one of the King's funeral. Wow I want to really find something very meaningful

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
you were

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
like let me recreate you know it all for

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
cornbread my not all of it. I just

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
wanted the last like the last symphony a voice a city hard to

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
be thinking something meaningful to assure him hopefully interested in some little fishy heaven.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Like I mean if Heaven has a pit stop.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I know that corporate is up there right mixes the Black Fish probably and he's OK. I

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
mean that was incredible. How many moment. Do you want

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to hear the really quick story of the one time we had a goldfish. Yes. Please.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So you know. When you're in elementary school they give you prizes redemption.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Yet you like so high because you're like oh my god my sister was like the top prize

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
for something on a member. She got a goldfish and brought it home and it came with one

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
thing fish food fish likes and

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
it's really really like Oh my God we have a pet they never let us have a pet and you know the goldfish

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
were so high.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And like we put it in this like place in our apartment like every morning would be like oh do you want to feed it I want to feed it you

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
know and

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
month. And in the bowl is just like little chunks

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
of

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
bread

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
where I like to chew.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And then there's a report for goldfish is

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:21.000

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
If you get you know the

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
song that's beautiful.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
we are unbelievably excited

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
thrilled nervous. There's this

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
catenary. Audie Cornish host of N.P.R.'s All Things Considered on the show today how

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
well she's covered everything from elections natural

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
disasters interview world leaders artists. I mean just everyone. So we

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
are thrilled to be doing an interview with someone who's interviewed millions of people are also very nervous to do

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
an interview with a man

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
who literally does this like perfectly for a living and has

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for I'll tell you say my way about you too though because you know you're in

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
the aisle it's

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
so fun and casual and I was like I've been listening to it actually

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
for myself to some with listening to interview is trying to figure out how they do what they do and dissect

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
it and you two are very good so yeah I'm nervous.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So it makes me feel better that we're all nervous. Yes I was

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
told there would be drinks. I don't know you know I do the Oh absolutely

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I was like you can lie and you can only either and should you know.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Next time we're recording in New York an audience in N.P.R. headquarters in Washington

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
where there are no

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
drinks to tell you know you're going on the you're in the you need it.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So we are thrilled that you're here welcome and thank you and we're

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
going to start off with our typical question what do you do in why

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
am I consider myself a reporter even though I've been a host of the show for the

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
last couple of years and I've almost always been in public radio and

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I guess I do it because I love the sound of people's voices like.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
For real even when I was a print reporter I would come back from

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
a story and think oh that person they just had a lovely accent or way of

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
speaking and I really wish I could hear it and I still

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
feel pretty

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
strongly about that I love that that was a great answer so speaking of

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
voices we asked Twitter if anybody had any questions for you. And I think one of the

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
first questions that

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
we got is how did you get such a great voice. Now

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I do this and conscious thing where when I'm talking to somebody who speaks very like proper and

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
like and legibly I guess like I

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
can feel like try to like them the my own acts and in my chatter like put on my professional voice which I think

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I'm doing now I'm trying not

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
to it's easier for me not to and I have liquor don't have like a

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
name but I mean I don't know how this works like other classes

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that you take to get like the non regional diction thing than have you ever

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
had an ad that's a good question and people have been asking a lot.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I know you guys had Gene Demby on from N.P.R.'s Code Switch team to talk about

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
the hash type of radio voices and what people were saying

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
about kind of the you know unbearable whiteness of public radio which I you know I I

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
think I really understand where people are coming from with

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that for me I will say that my family. They're

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
all

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Jamaican but I grew up in Massachusetts and I just ended up with no

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
accent and that sucks right because for both of those

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
communities accents are a big deal. Jamaicans really love their accents as they should because they're

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
beautiful weather twice for the broadcasters I mean it's really

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
gorgeous Caribbean accents and in Massachusetts you know badge of honor.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
You know like you know you look you.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
It's like part of being you know from that place and

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I didn't have it so it's very interesting to basically spend my

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
entire childhood as an out. Sider because of my

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
voice finally get this job where I'm like paid to have

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
this voice and that have all these people be like but it's not good enough.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Why do you want from me you know I don't know so that. I don't know if that

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
answers that question. There's no classes there's no nothing this is just my voice and

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
you know I'm I like

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
a way people feel about what it means to be black what it means

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to be professional like all of these stereotypes. Like I feel bad

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
for people if they want to say you don't know but this is telling me more about you.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Yeah and it is about like your right to use about who I am and what I sound like and what

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I should sound like I didn't mean to go off on a tear there but I have a little bit about

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that publicly and I think that I've been meaning to say that

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
somewhere. Please go off on any tears

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Yeah you know I'm going to follow you anyway so we

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
heard many tall tales about how people when they meet you they're always surprise that you're black

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
they expect you to be white.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Yes black and white people of all races all ages who seems the most surprised

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
everybody just Alys freaking out whenever you know first of all in public radio there's a certain amount

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
of disappointment you have to bear. Regardless when people

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
meet you you and you can just see the light dim in their

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
eyes and they're like You're not what I thought you were thinking like first

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
of all were you thinking like you knew that second of

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
all you know what exactly did you imagine So you're not what they imagined and so that's

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
OK I think black people are more like happy

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
to explain their surprise you know I think for white people there's like a certain amount

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
of like politeness about well I don't want to say what I

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
thought I'm like that's going to get awkward.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So that doesn't. Happen but yeah black people are definitely happy to be like what you know I

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
don't know the mind of

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
yesterday yet I like to listen

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and I don't mind

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
that because again I think one of the things I loved about the rise of like the black

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
nerd which it's like it's our time there's not all that like we don't have to deal with all

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
this policing of blackness. You know it's like you can be

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
yourself and that's OK and I feel like

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
collectively we're not so fearful of who we

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
are wherever you are on the I don't know what this would be the

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000
delusional spectrum of well I don't know how would you measure the phase.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So you done maybe a million interviews

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
approximating give or take.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I was listening to interview where you were saying like still every like ten

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
minutes before an interview you get nervous and ten minutes after you're

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
like I failed. Does that ever go away. You say

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
yes we say you know we have done things and you know you should

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
hope it

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
does the right because meeting people is scary you know that's why we get into an

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
elevator and we like move to

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
corners like we're naturally inclined to be like that today my for yeah I

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
agree the press door close. Like

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I did. And naturally I

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
don't I'm nervous and I you know I was not popular in high school do you know

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I mean I just was not a person who was naturally inclined to have conversation

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
with strangers it's being a reporter that's turned me into that and it does

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
feel sometimes like there's a Clark Kent effect where

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I things I would not do in my regular

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
life. I will do because I am reporting and

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.000
interviewing

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
someone so it doesn't go away. I hope it doesn't go. Because the day that

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I'm like bored an interested in not worried about talking to someone.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Well then I'm not curious anymore. And what's the point of that and I don't

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
know about you but part of this job is just figuring out

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
how to channel that energy. You know I think Bobby McFerrin

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
said something like Does it matter if you have butterflies if they're all going in the same direction.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Wow you're

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
also referred overtly on that. So you claim but I think you with yeah yeah

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I really love I mean experience that out by the

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
milkman Yeah he's amazing. And he does the is an amazing teacher anyways.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
So I have taken that to heart very much. I feel like

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
yes butterflies. Let's get it. Line.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I guess in a field

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
where there aren't that many people that look like you. Were you able

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
to find mentors.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Well first of all that is a good question that you should also ask like just about

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
any black

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
professional I think that is why reality where yeah I mean it is

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
it's the reality of being a person of color and kind of a bird

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
mobility and where we are as a community that there are lots of firsts right and

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
there's lots

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
of seconds and thirds and people who had to

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
create mentors maybe were it didn't seem like there naturally would be

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I will say that I am very aggressive and believe very deeply in mentorship so when

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I was an intern there were a couple of people that

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I came to N.P.R. and went to their office and just you know was like knock knock knock.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Hi it's me. I want to learn what you do. Let's talk about that.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Like if you do that to five people one or two of them will help you either because they have

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
like Hugo's want to help you you know and I think that's

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
something that's really hard to to kind of make that conceptual leap.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
If you are.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
If you didn't grow up in that world which I did not. To be like

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
yeah someone should answer my questions yes. Somebody should help me because I am here. You

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
know that's something that like entitled young people take for granted hello you

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
know I

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
assume this is why I'm here so that people can help me get to the next level and I feel like when

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
you're working class kid you don't feel that way you're like I just don't want to mess up. I

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
definitely found people who mentored me and one thing about N.P.R. In particular there's so

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
many outstanding women here you know Michel Martin and Michele Norris

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
and you know Nina Totenberg like then is kick ass

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
like off air you know she's the kind of person who pulls you aside and says listen

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
you need to do this this and that like don't let them push you around I mean she's just

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
grade and Cokie Roberts and you know definitely men Steve Inskeep like there are

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
people who said who were happy to talk to me about

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
craft and I've always been really grateful. But I'm going to

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
take credit for myself

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
and yes I like that I wasn't afraid to do it.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Yeah and I think that something that like it's really hard to get

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
over. I just love hearing women do that that's made me so happy that I have a question

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
about the planning of your show and the people that you

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
tend to profile we notice that there was an interview that you did with

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
black artists like you know while

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
you're little by little

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I mean. Well I think you

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
may Wiley So how involved are you with like the actual planning of your

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
show how many of the guests you entertain and interview

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
are people that you specifically wanted to talk to like I'm always interested see like how

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
things work.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Yeah yeah yeah I know I was reading about your your meeting and you guys talking about like how you put

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
it together and I felt the same way. You know for us we have the news right so

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
sometimes you just get there and you're like Iran deal discuss like let's try and.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Find five angles on this fifty people

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
haven't done already. I think some of the interviews you guys are pointing to particularly with

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
artists they are things that I chose myself. Maybe because I knew

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
about those people already. Maybe because I have read about them. Maybe

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
because they're just do in the case of say Kinney Wiley and Kara Walker. These

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
are two well known. Well regarded artists who are

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
like pretty close to retrospective mode

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
right there already at the point where people are like let's look back on the

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Greatness like I said they hadn't been interviewed before by us. Yeah

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
was weird and an

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
oversight one fun thing about this job you asked me earlier of like kind of when I feel I came into my

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
own it was like making selections like that. Like my ability to get something like that to

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
air to get through the whole interview without

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
saying and African-American artists you know I mean like right to write interview with a black

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
person without saying they're black you know because does it matter. Like when

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
it matters we'll talk about it but when it doesn't matter why do you expect me to say

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
it in a way you kind of see your humanity right by saying like we're not other right.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
We're here right. We're in the midst of this world like anyone else and we're going to be talked

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
about

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
like anyone else. Those interviews in particular that's kind of what's in my head when I'm doing

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
it I was going through some of your

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
tweets. And you were no I'm the worst.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I don't believe that my IS THE INTERVIEWER Yeah exactly what you were

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
talking a little bit about your frustration with hate mail from listeners. When you whenever you

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
have rapper R. and B. on your show.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
That's an N.P.R. thing I mean I don't know if you heard recently people were getting all fired up that Kim

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Carr

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Dashiell she was on actually I'm

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
sorry Kim Cardassian was on WAIT WAIT DON'T TELL ME LIKE which is a very fun show. Yeah it's a fun

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
show with silly people right like in the listing of people can crash and not that

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
much of a stretch she's probably the

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
hottest. Well you know it's a great Barcelona.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
But I think

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
that for a long time for the people who grew up with Public

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Radio and by that I mean the people who we who traditionally when

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
people make jokes about public radio write the kind of delicious

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
dish joke driving speaking people

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
and flatters you know. I think there is a group of people who feel like hey

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
this thing is for us and we're here because we fled pop culture. We're here because

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
we're kind of overwhelmed and we want to break and I think in some ways that's fair you

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.000
know

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
like is there no place where we're not safe from a car dash in I mean if

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
we're being honest there is a limit to what you want to

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
write a journalistic

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
question should you flip out because they show up probably not you know

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.000
it's

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
just not that deep and I think this is the same group of people who struggle

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
with hip hop as an art form and I think again. This gets back to

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
my kind of greater

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
or sort of thesis about what I do which is that I'm not going to

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
pretend hip hop is an other music.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
And that it is like Fringe or cutting edge like this means it's been

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
around for a long time we're getting pretty clear like mere oldies

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
right left right now right under a you know. Yeah I remember

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
once being at some kind of event where people were

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
like it's throwback to when the swelling just came

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
out and. Yeah I

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
was no feeling ready to be like adult

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
contemporary

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
music of my youth. So again like we bring those artists on and I

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
still do err on the side of trying

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
to bring in artists who have something to say or something interesting to say who tell

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
their story. Well you know that's a bias I have you know as much as

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I might like a certain kind of hip hop song which is like the same couple of

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
words said thousand times.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
That's not a good conversation. Like

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
so

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Versace you know like I do you do after that if you have

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
an interview he goes yeah

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
yeah like people don't you know everyone's story but I'm looking

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
for people who have

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
as good an interesting story to tell often in five minutes or less. It's awful to say but it's

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.000
the

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:44.000
truth.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
This is a thing and then I think interview we have at Thousand Questions that we didn't get to

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
but we do want to steer towards our son rapid fire question portion of the

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
show you know

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
the rapid fire I am Public Radio I don't really know I can handle it. We

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
say rapid fire but it's really just an excuse to get us to ask you your question the

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
OK they're not very fast at all

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
so people get very upset with that and we don't ask this of each and every one of our guests. So we're

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
going to ask you what are your thoughts on

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:24.000
the world.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Thoughts

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
in

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
general OK. My dad used to say like squirrel like is a weird way of pronouncing

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
it and now when I write more it was square

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Well I don't know. I'm

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
not sure he just he did something with the You and I and now

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
whenever I see it it's like. It's like a script

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
traffic cone. You know like I see it on the paper in my mind I'm like squirrels

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
squirrels girls we're all so I'm glad it's not a word I have to

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
say very often until now apparently Me Why Do You Do You.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Trust you like Mitt Romney did you. Just like I do you feel you know

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
I'm a pearl I'm writing to ask you know about where the plane landed

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
a big play there has been in epidemic lately of drunk squirrels is like but you

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
know everything a place that's not a New York thing I feel like everything's a little bit Janki

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
there like even the squirrels with eagle you know a

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
bit much. I'm of the opinion

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
that squirrels are terrible wherever you are anyway where

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
it spit into my time of growth such thing as i'm absolutely.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
I was I was reading through your tweets I saw a lot of Empire treats Yes.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
So I have a

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
question do you actually like the music on Empire. How do you feel about the music.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
I love it I think it's a kind of performance art and Timberland is actually my obsession

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
this is my next interview I really want to get if you're listening because I

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
have bear with me I know it's a lightning round but very quickly. I feel like. Empire in the

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
show Nashville are mirror images of each

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
other and the music of Nashville. They like went

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
to writers and tried to make it very authentic blah blah

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
blah and empire does the same thing you know music that is sort of

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
bad is authentically bad music that it's supposed to like harken to a certain era.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Does that and yell admit the first time I heard drip

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
drop like a real down for real. You know like I wanted to turn off my

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
dignity back away from it such a bad and what ended up in your head I think I can't get it out of

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.000
my

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
head to make

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.000
that

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
change and he just

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I find myself being like you know you know like drip drop my web site explain it to my

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
husband and he's like. Let's never speak of this again and then when I. Here

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
is still you know conqueror which is a

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
real song you know and like done well I think it's great you

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
know so I think

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
that I don't ironically love the music on Empire I legitimately

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
love it whether it's good or not that's

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:32.000
a great beautiful thesis.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I thought of love empire and scandal together kind of sort

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
of yes operatic their operas. Yes Yes Not soap operas

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
proper operas and.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
You still watch the show correct. I'm a die hard scandal but I mean no matter how bad it

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
gets that it gets bad oh my God I don't know if you can hear me I love

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
you I will still watch the hell out of

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
that but you are the perfect person to ask a question to what would have to happen on scandal

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
for you to stop watching

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
it both me until you stop watching Lee I didn't listen even when I don't know if

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
I can do this anymore you know I had my last use on that I totally get it I totally think I have

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
a deep commitment to Shonda Rhimes is I know about. You know it's not a two way faith.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Thank you because a very. I have

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
been tested with the exit of Jake. Euler I don't know if

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
he's really accident or not I'm a huge fan of Scott Foley

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
and I thought he had brought some good heat in the decision to the show.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Yeah

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
yeah. So I don't know maybe we're there yet but to

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
me as long

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
as you know Kerry Washington is delivering those Sean the

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
speeches like you know I'll go with the I mean I came back around to Grey's Anatomy.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Oh yeah. I'm still watching great then that's when I gave up on organized but it has

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
its moments a great deal if you will sort. E-R.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
was bad for a while and then came back around and everyone's like oh yeah you

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
are great. No no no I had some rough times and I feel like you know shadow

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
shows sometimes like she has to launch other things and sometimes in her absence. You

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
know some There can be some dark moments. So what

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
if in the next episode of Scandal right. Livia gets kidnapped

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
by some

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
radioactive girls or squirrel with

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
like lasers had to like they head in there like now we're going

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
to sell you to the Russians and the Russians are like OK yeah I'm going to be like I mean

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
so when once the radio I mean that I tried to get away the last season.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I thought it all had there been

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Dolphins' like episodes two or three maybe they're right.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Yeah I'm in the squad. I watch private practice and I had all my good

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
the

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000
very very I got to the only person I can say that was.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Because for me there's so much great amazing television but

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I like seeing myself reflected in the stories sometimes it's not a

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
requirement for me to enjoy

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
T.V. but it's kind of nice you know what it looks like when you have

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
to power through a meeting. Yeah and tell people what's up and.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
And you're not a bitch you know I mean you're not like an angry Negro woman. You

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
were just another amazing character in the Tablo of amazing characters

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
and she's going to give me that and so I'm always going to reward her with my little Nielsen

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
rating if I can raise you to fall.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Well in

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
my questions with you so Gene Demby tells us that you are a very

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
stylish style

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
icon very for radiographs or whatever anyone tells you just but for radio what it's

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
like on

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
radio why why do you still get so why. Believe absolutely is

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
exact his exact phrasing during a D.J. conversation.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Is why the fuck you get so flat a go on the radio on the radio

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000

to see it but I can feel it

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
yeah it's

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
a lovely dark lip and I you know I want to get there I haven't

that another

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
round make of it I'm with

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
it I do it because

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
I am nervous and I feel like your costume

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
is is your armor and you know I know that there are some women

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
who they're not big on makeup or wearing heels or things like that they have very good

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
and amazing and many times feminist rooted reasons for believing

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
that for me I take all that stuff and I are myself with

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
it you know it might as well be a shield and there are some days where I I want people to

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
be intimidated so I'm like yes this is red lipstick.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
It is aligned. It is pristine Oh yeah well Taylor I did it so you know you're never

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
going to do that ignited

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
there and same thing with dressing there's times when I like I meet a band you know I don't want to be

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
dressed like I'm going to meet a

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
congressman and when I go out in the field for especially disaster reporting and reporting

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
like I went to Charleston after the shooting. I dress very

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
very plainly you know I don't even wear my eyeglasses which had like ten pairs

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
because I don't

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
want to be judged in that moment. And when you meet people and talk

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
to people they judge you they can't help but they look at you take you in and go oh you're this

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
person and so then I wear a kind of plain costume so that I can deflect

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
some of that so. For the radio it just makes me feel good and it gets me in

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
a in a place you know where I can do the performance part of

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
it and in real life it's about meeting people where they are

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.000
who

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
are beautiful of the work of art hell's wrong with

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
that I have not

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
random Last question What is the wildest workplace Mike regressions

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
experience in your mind to hire

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
correctly in my entire career in

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
any job. But I know but microaggression it's a very millennial thing like I

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
feel like this was just called life

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
before you really like got

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
like identified it you named it in shame did it and that's only helping

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
you and say what I am did until I got a brother out now where was

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
that a micro-grid or was that Tuesday.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I mean it's a microgram to do this.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I'm going to be of noxious and say I can't remember that but I think that's allowed a

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
that I would not have gotten to this point in my career.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
If I took those on board and held on to them it's

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
just impossible. I ran a

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
gauntlet of people who underestimated me write every story subject is like you're using

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
in turn every lawmaker is like I don't understand who you

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
are you know people don't see me and so when they finally meet me they're not sure what to

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
think there's been lots of stuff like that and I think the only way you can get through this

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
job or any other job or people will underestimate you on a rival is to

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
just not onboard it. If that makes sense right like I can't collect

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
it and so maybe it means I've been successful because I can't

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.000
remember

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
any OH MY GOD THAT. When I walk around

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
the collection plate. I don't

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
like having was silently waving your hand in the

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
air but keep doing it millennial keep tumbler ing it every

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
day for my age group you know

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I'd be in that like Polly So I want to one class like telling some other student like this happening that

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
happen you don't see it in ages

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
because I don't see reason

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
like we had to just keep that to ourselves and go right back to the

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
life we grow dorm. And like you guys get to be

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
like well that's stupid and you know. I don't like to have these conversations

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
out and people write think pieces and everyone please come toss me you know like

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000

this world. You were very dubious.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
So here you have to praise it like it's been fantastic

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
so thank you for having I will cry Oh I was

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Can you say this is another round and I'm Audie Cornish in your

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.000
radio and your

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
radio is my review and your

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
voice here and go. For another round.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I'm Audie Cornish.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Thank you

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.000
so

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:29.000
much.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And now for some inspirational wears on us.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
This

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
is what we do to hold people back. This is what we do and we get to something that's

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
also been working for a long time when you don't have to be races anymore. It's called self

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
hate it works on a selfish like real estate of

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
racism where just like that when someone comes up and says something like I'm a guy.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Everybody says Who does he think he

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
is I just told you who I thought I

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
was. I just told you that's who I think I am I

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.000
would have been better if I had a song to say I am a nigger. I'm a gangster.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I'm a

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
pimp all those colors I'm putting this bit

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
better on a person like me right. But to say you

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
are God. Especially when you get shipped over to the country that you're in and your last

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
name is a slave owners.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
How could you say that. How could you have that

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
mentality and was that always feel like

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
I could do

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
anything. That's the main thing people are controlled

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
by their perception of

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
themselves their slow down by their perception of themselves. If you talk

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
you can do anything you won't do anything. I was taught to do everything

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
since age thirty six. So just watch

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:55.000
the next ten

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
years when my stamina and French and friends.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
And then with that line around what is it. I want to buy a round

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
for disposable cameras. So I was

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
moving and I found three old disposable cameras and I was like

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
oh my god what is on here and I remembered like three summers ago I was living with my best

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
friend and we gave each other cameras and we just like. We had

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
phones but it is like let's just play with this you know and I was like oh

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
my God what if it's from that summer I was so hype and then I was like OK let me try to find

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
a C.V.S. that does this. And it was

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
a journey it was

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
a journey and they had to like they don't even do it in the store anymore they like export it

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
out so she's like you want to

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
develop photos like yes ma'am.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And then I developed them and they were so good oh well. Oh good

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
is it was from that summer it was just like a bunch of like Silly very un posed

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
for like snapshots of what we did that summer and I know

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
it's dumb because it's like I mean I could develop the photos on like my camera roll like they had this thing in

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
the C.V.S. where you could like connect your phone and just print some photos I'm like OK I'll try to keep up you know.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
But there's just something so nice about that like not knowing what the picture looks like

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
right that produces like like a really intimate photo

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
and one of the photos in there

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
was a summer fling I had but I forgot a

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
little and we were at a party and I met this

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
random person we were talking for a while. And this I was just like you know I'm

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
feeling fine let me

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
think you know that you were

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
you and it was just so because I

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
like I kind of forgot what he looked like and then I found this does.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
As well Kim and I had like two pictures of him now whereas I would never have had those

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
pictures like this it wasn't for

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
this because he like he was visiting from the U.K. and he was like in

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
New York for like three days. It's like this very like rom com serendipitous thing.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
The reason he came was because his grandma died and she gave him a bunch of money and was like go

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
visit this one place in little in Little Italy and we had a little

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
fling who took some pictures and. He was

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
like do you want to come with me to the place my grandma wants me to go I was

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
like No absolutely not but it's just so nice to have like

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
a memorialization of that one you know it's good

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
that was that was that's like that's like a private don't know if

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
you want me just

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
met. Anyways pictures of your summer plans that this will

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
get him Who are you buying around for the future you see

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
I am buying a very nice alcoholic around for somebody who is not yet old enough to drink.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Mrs Mandel a standby or clue us flexing on everybody

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
via Twitter Who Is She Really what if people don't know who she is well a

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
man listin Barak is an American actress known for her role as a rule in The Hunger Games.

Yes and she is like what sixteen seventeen. Yeah like literally just

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
what the problem with Jaden Smith Oh my God Those pictures were those are people I may think.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
But she's very vocal and outspoken and just like so woke for a celebrity one of her life that made

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
her age for tooth was right made a video talking about in the explaining in a

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
very patient in a form and. In a manner that like. Only like the You'd have

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
the energy

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.000
to do

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
you can't fathom the cultural

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
appropriation and how it's really fucked up that like when

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
like white girls discover cornrows for example right and my thing you know

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
but like black women who wear cornrows often vilified. You know there was a video that she's just been very

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
vocal and

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
outspoken. A while ago there was this whole quote unquote feud thing

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
between her and Kylie Jenner. Because Kylie tweeted a

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.000
few

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
to well nobody could see my quote right there were air quotes not an

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
actual feud. Kylie

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Jenner poem but you know

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
the. More One way was

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
right. Kylie Jenner posted a picture

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
of herself on Instagram with cornrows right in a manly just like very calmly

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
rolled through she just like you know it's cultural appropriation that it would be really cool if you know you gave

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
back to the community taken

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
from blighted by black everybody on the Internet was like the black woman on the Internet

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
and like the while white folks.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Yes So it's good it's so

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
refreshing to see somebody so young and brown and female not only

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
like use her voice the way that she does but to use it for like some actual like good

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
shit right now it's amazing what you don't call me like an angry black

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
woman I'm reading my opinion like this like I'm not going to do you think I'm not angry.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Yes And I also really love the way that black women on the Internet rallied around

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
her when freakin Andy Cohen from Bravo. Oh God

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
this fucker. He thought it would be the carjack call because

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
of the comments that he made completely not acknowledging that the comments that he made were pretty

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
freakin valid culture a jackhole a jackal

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
So he has that is listen he has his I can regularly segment of this.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Yeah yeah there's like a particle of it there. You should let

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
it actually touching the human origin but right home and out of everybody in front of camera has no clue

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
if you know this is not a professional.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
So yes he wanted her for which he didn't like the Internet really rallied around her that

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
hashtag there was a boycott Bravo whatever and first it was like I wasn't calling her a jackhole

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
I did the light online few quite awhile and then later he definitely did apologize

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.000
that

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
clapped out our game plan that a man listed

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
by its head. This baby. So I mean it's

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
hard for her not to like be woken from the very beginning when she stepped

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
on the stage. People were upset because she was like a brown character right there like we didn't

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
know room was brown right. I never imagined her to

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
be Brown this punk and the reason my mom is not hers but she's very clear

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
this right is brown in The Hunger Games. So you made the conscious choice to just like

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
eggs any and I'll brown people from this don't let your shoes brown them but you see you described is like

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
having like so you're upset someone casting something

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
properly. Have any danger this is how I'm stuck in my

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
imagination or

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
to literally she did so that's who my round is for a man love.
