00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So today's a very special episode and I think anyone believe that today is happening. We are in

Davenport Iowa listening that the play first to new we have seen three

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
black people getting to where we were at the airport and twenty other morons in the ville to get the

F. word. While you know what I'll ave

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
up

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
before we interview Madam Secretary I want to read a bunch of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
things that I expect from the next president. So these are two man that I have

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
actually used and know about tracking tweets situation. It's an archive of Tracy's brain. So these are tweets

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that I've actually sent to the current sitting president Most course of things that I would like

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
me before he leaves and what are few of these Tracy I'm scared to ask.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
OK. Don't be scared because I have a logical thing that should be expected of anyone who is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the leader of the free world they're all very doable. OK before you leave office can

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
you institute some harsh penalties on people who leave backpacks on on Kravitz right. Oh

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
my God we need that. OBAMA

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We need this is what it was whatever you have been a dream of for Happy us a sandwich out of the out people act

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
like they don't know how to hold backpacks why they put it on the floor and yes this is not going to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
be all over my face.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Also please ban any feminism that is not intersectional things and I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
mean that's Don't be a right to say. That's a graphical you know and I'm thin. So you've

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
treated all of this at all. I'm already

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Absolutely. If I could have Obama Grammy ONE WISH I think this is what it would be. The

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
make the middle relive a

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
little imo. Oh my God. What not is so I think the worst idea.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's not me

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
about the McRib Why would anyone need that more than how much it is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
available because this is delicious and sometimes you just need some mystery

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
meat and not barbecue sauce I can say that you know I can't say that the three

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to disagree. OK can we declare people who don't like them are all of the protected

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
class lower than me or him a hero. I said on Twitter once that I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
don't enjoy cinnamon rolls not because they don't taste good because sentiment of that must them but a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
loud biological reason I had so many hate tweets from people that thought I was

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
my free is about my own five free is a nobody wrote me no one else like I don't feel

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
safe in this moment. OK so I feel like when you want to be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
protected capitally like black people yes. Queer people absolutely people

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
who don't like cinnamon rolls.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We're a very small minority and we're not safe on American soil. It is true Americans we love

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
them so maybe

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the US they do love themselves and sit around and they absolutely do. That's

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
wild sure if we had years I would just like to feel safe in the country

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
where af a taxi sometimes has Obama ever responded to any of these streets. Now and I wonder

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
why because he's busy OK because had one gotten around to

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
all he's like That's not a protected class. OK I have one more I have one where is there a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
particular bureau that I should complain to when I order curly

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
fries and most of them are just like Barry Kirby. OH MY

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
GOD THAT agree on the show. Number one the gentle and OK they're right that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
we agree on something that is so rude like you know audio

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
viral tripods probably fries are my favorite flavor of fries.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I realize we are in shape but come on they're all full flavor. You can just curl up

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Friday like curly fries have a very and then when you. You order them curly fries and you get to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that actually curly and the rest of us rang true to its allies fall and eyes and straight

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
fries right. I do realize that something strong comes up. So these are things that I will

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
like her president to do in this not current president the next president and perhaps our guest

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
today can help us out with some of these things but I'm probably not going

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to bring them up. Because who says those things out loud me.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Well

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
before you start it we Same to you some bourbon well part hey that's so

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
much still to do if it were I'm not sure the last event of my day I thought it will

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
rain tonight is that right Kat and I do and drink it I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
think so we are here in Iowa with Hillary Clinton

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.000
aka Val

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The bartender. Madam Secretary I know you're a very busy woman so I just

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
get started in a speech in

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Oregon in twenty fourteen you talked a little bit about the level of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
relentless scrutiny that stock people in public life that gives you a sense of being quote kind

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
of dehumanized as part of the experience. I mean you've been in political life for like decades

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
now how and you have to be on for so long how in the world do you stay

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
same environment. I don't

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
understand it's not easy Can I tell you really it's something that you have to be aware of

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and try

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to fill your day and certainly your life

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
with people you care about people that you want to spend time with activities that are just fun.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I you know even though my husband was governor of Arkansas for all those years you know I drove

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
myself around. I went to work every day I took my daughter to school or to ballet.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I had a really just Khana run of the mill ordinary life

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and it wasn't until he became president that I

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
really encountered that overwhelming. Sense of the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
bubble of the scrutiny.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So I don't know that you ever get used to it but you do sort of learn how

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to manage it so that you can get up

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
every day and go about your life yet we talk a lot about self care on our show look just day to day

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
things you think take care of yourself what's important what do you do for self care right when you

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
mention activities and you know what activities.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I really love yoga. I love long walks

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
go on those Any chance I get my husband I take our two dogs we

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
go walking around where we live in New York

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
when we can you know just things that you feel like oh my gosh this

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
is what it's meant to be this is what I want to do and I

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
try to fit that in as often as I

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
can. There was a moment when you on the campaign trail in two thousand a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
famous moment one of my favorite moment that I've ever seen from a politician which I have like

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
maybe two or three for a political moment and I thought of our son

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and maybe three.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But you were in New Hampshire and someone asked you like how do you get up in go out the door every day and you get very very

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
emotional I did I know that there's been a lot of talk about what led up to that moment but how did you feel

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
afterwards like when you got home that night were you like I should have done

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that you feel like you wish on a sign of weakness or did you feel powerful and like normal.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
How did you feel when it was over.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
That's a great question and I don't know that anybody has ever asked that of me

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
before I did not know that's how I was going to feel at

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the time I was doing an event and I was sitting in a like

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
a cafe a little restaurant

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and people were asking me questions and they were asking me about political issues and then

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I was asked you know how do you get up and do this

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and it was a combination for me

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of feeling like if somebody asked me a really personal

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
question and it's very hard out there this is this

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
is something

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that. Just demand your mental emotional

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
physical stamina all the time

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and I just felt like you know how do

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I get up every day and do this.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And when it was over I just felt drained I didn't feel any thing other than that

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I didn't realize was going to be such a big deal to be honest. And then it became this big deal

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and I thought that was sort of interesting that it did become such a big deal

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
because to me those moments sometimes like like yesterday I

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
met one of the mothers from Sandy Hook and you know she'd come to

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
meet me I didn't know she was going to be there I didn't know anything at all until she just came up

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to me before I went out to the event and I

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
just I could just feel myself getting really emotional about it

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and those moments happen. You know like even like about two weeks ago I met

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
this young man is taking care of his mother with all

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
timers and he said I need help and I will tell me what you need and he

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
said I'm taking care of my mom she is all times I can't afford a caregiver. I can't quit my

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
job because then we won't have any way to make ends meet so I take her to work with

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
me every day. So when something real pierces

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the sort of political screen that you

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
all you know anyone in this arena you all know gets built up because you're

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
getting incoming and you're getting lots of questions about all this stuff.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's a moment that induces this kind of

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
emotional personal reaction which is what happened there.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I was surprised that people. Well maybe I should have been surprised that people thought you were

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
faking people often say that you're like some sort of like robotic like

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
rehearsed person. Do you resent that like relatability is the kind of currency

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
that politics works with instead of like the

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
years the decades already with their actual ability but I think part of

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
it is as a woman you're.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Really held to a totally different

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
standard and you're expected to be both

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
strong and vulnerable at the same time. That's not easy to do.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And so you just have to be who you are to the best of your ability but it

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
is somewhat frustrating because I know a lot of

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
women in politics who are on the front lines or women in any

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
profession media business you name it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
You know we talk about this we all feel like if you do it you're criticize if you don't do it you're

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
criticized and instead it's down so hard to

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
get people to realize that you know we're all different we may all be women

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
but you know we all have our strengths we have our weaknesses.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We all get up every morning and do the best we can and eventually people

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
either get to or they don't and you know when I ran for the Senate back

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in ninety nine. You know I was very

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
much facing the same kinds of questions like

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
well you know what about this what about that cetera et cetera. And

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I just got up every day and worked as hard as I

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
could even in this last presidential campaign as you point out. I mean it's such

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
a marathon and it's so hard and

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
then you know when President Obama asked me to be secretary of state it was a

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
different kind of platform and because I wasn't in politics.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
People were really nice about me so they said all kinds of nice things which you know I

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
appreciate it but then as soon as I said I was going to run for president. So the Republicans

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and the pundits and all of that so I've gotten kind of used to it but it

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
does still pose this conundrum. How is a woman supposed to be

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
hey Well how about the way she is and then people should figure out her as opposed to her after.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
To figure out everybody else.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Yeah we talk a lot about being a woman in the workplace Yeah I was really interested the story. SENATOR

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
JOE A Brand talked about last year she said. I want to quote because it's a great

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
quote to talk about some of the comments congressman have made about her body and just the harassment she's experience

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
from other male senators she talked about she wanted to cry or

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
disappear but I didn't hear a word he said I was in a place where I could tell him to go fuck himself.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Are you in a place to tell your male colleagues to go

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
fuck them. And have you ever. Yes I have

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
but I have my belly Well I don't know I mean but I've

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
encountered those kinds of situations over

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
the years and you know sometimes you just have

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
to ignore what's happening because there's a

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
larger issue you're trying to deal with and sometimes you have to confront it and it's almost a snap decision.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I remember I was in a situation where I was

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
delivering some apparently pleasant news to a group of men about an

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
issue and literally one of them reached over and grabbed

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
my

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
shirt and today. You can't be telling us

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
this and I just get your hands off of me.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I've been around a lot. And I've had a lot of

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
challenges but what I have found is that the vast majority of

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
them can be dealt with by a c'mon

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
really pushing back.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Basically saying you got to be kidding me or did you just hear what you said not

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
accelerating it. You know making it even a bigger confrontation but then sometimes you have to do

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
what you have to do the found that men are

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
receptive to that sort of the most. Hey man you know and then do they like I would I ever had

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
a male running well to chill out you know I don't I don't use that I say Did you hear what you

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
just yeah. I've had

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
some I've had some luck with that over the years sometimes nothing

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
helps usually up against somebody who is got his own problems

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
that he's trying to yeah people kind of made a point about how she didn't need Senator Joe brand. Name any

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
names but I got the sense just from the stories that this is a very common thing on the Hill

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
do you feel like just women on the Hill are telling each other about who to avoid

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and who always says the knowing things in the meeting are like

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
whatever you know I think that happened you know every day Larry. Yeah that you know that does happen I mean

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
they're there when I got

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
there it was clear there were some people that were just troubling and they

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
just you just wanted to avoid them you want to just leave them and I don't know who

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
your son's talking about

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but there were some people

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
who crossed the line in the way they treated women and.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And so you just again. You either dealt with it or you ignored it

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and that's pretty much what she says she

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
did so we want to transition a little to talk about black lives matter and we talk we've talked a lot

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
of on the honor show about.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Sed the recent barrage of stories about black people being killed by the police.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I want to quote specifically from the encounter you had with black lives matter activists a few weeks

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
ago you were saying look I don't believe in change hearts. I believe in change laws

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
change allocation of resources you change the way systems operate. You're not going to change every heart you're not.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I don't want to speak for them but I don't know if anyone is suggesting like policy doesn't matter. I'm more

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
curious generally to hear how you see racial change happening in America especially as a as a

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
white person who was radicalized by Martin Luther King you talk a lot about

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
how hearing him speak and then. His assassination

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
like was really deeply meaningful to your young life. You

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
know. Well I had what I thought was a very honest

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
very open conversation with the activists that

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I met with I'm going to be meeting with some more of my staff is in

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
constant contact with them.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I still admire their passion and their

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
intensity in reacting to what is a terrible

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
continuing systemic prob. Home of Race and Justice in

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
America and there's no doubt in my mind that they have helped

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
to galvanize opinion across the country and that they have

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
given real energy to trying to get

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
some changes quickly made as like the president's policing

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Commission has recommended and

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
others. But I was sounding a note of caution

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
because again having done this for a long

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
time I don't want anybody who has that level of

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
intelligence and energy and

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
commitment to get discouraged

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
to walk away from the hard work it takes in

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
politics to make

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
changes. Because we need them. We need their voices we need their

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.000
activism

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and I've seen myself a lot

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
of change that has happened and it matters. I mean the Civil

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Rights Act mattered. The Voting Rights Act mattered but what I think people

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
have learned is that there is no way that progress continues.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
If there is not constant pressure and absolutely. I guess

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I'm curious more generally what do you think it would take for other white people to see the problems that we see.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Oh I think a lot do. I mean let's you know let's come. Yeah it's not I'm not looking about you know

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
very I think there's just I think the frustration of that interaction was not that the

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
policy wasn't right. We can talk about policy but that like on a basic level people feel like they're not

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
being heard like black lives matter is a pretty

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
simple. Please Right right. You know it

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
is but if it's going to be a movement and not just a plea. Then

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
it has to build on making changes that people either have

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
to accept or they have to embrace.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And in many ways getting people to accept. The changes that are

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
necessary will require consistent pressure and leadership

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
at all levels in the community all the way to the White

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
House and that then you have to keep making the case as I have tried

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to make going back to going back a long time but in this campaign going back to the first speech I

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.000
gave

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
that Columbia University in New York. You've got to

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
be willing to constantly say there are gross

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
inequities and you can't act like they don't exist and one of the biggest is

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
the way that African-American particularly men but also women. But let's focus on

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
men for a

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
minute are arrested more charged more tried

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
more convicted more incarcerated

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
more than white men who do the very same things that that's just a fact and that is

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
a fact that you have to say over and over again as I have done to a lot of

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
audiences that are predominantly white and say Put yourself in the position of

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
either one of those young men or the mother or the father of one of those young men. How would you

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
feel and it's not a question that is easily answered by a

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
lot of white people because they don't have that experience and you've got to force

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
folks to kind of say to themselves. Hey if this is really happening and I

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
guess there is evidence to show it's

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
happening then maybe I'd better change my thinking about all of this.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
It's a scary slow start. Process but we made

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
progress now I think in some areas were stalled so we've got to you know put

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
some you know energy behind pushing forward and getting more people to do what they should

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.000
be doing

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
anyway I'm very glad that you mentioned the very deplorable

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
state of the prison system right now you're talking about how people of

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
color are arrested a disproportionate amount over white

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
folks and time this back into the black last matter movement or the conversation that

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
you had with the activists. Conversation felt very unfinished to me and I

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
was reading some interviews with the young woman who was talking to I think the name is Dan A.J. and see a helping

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
fan is right.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
My reading of it and again I don't want to speak for her my reading of it is that a lot of

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
people feel like you and your husband former President Bill

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Clinton are implicit in the the policies that were passed and some of

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
the legislation that was

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
passed in the ninety's the tough on crime

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
initiatives the three strikes rule. I feel like what they were looking for and what

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
a lot of black people are looking

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
for is for you in order has been to shoulder

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
some responsibility in the crisis that we're facing now. So my question to

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
you is do you ever look at the state of black America today we can

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
focus on the prison for now.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And regardless of what the intense were like I know that the ninety's were like it was a different time you know

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
times change legislation changes needs change

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
but regardless of your intent do you ever look at the State of Black America and say wow we really fuck this up

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
for black people.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Well today what I think and my husband spoke of this he spoke about this at the end of a

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
C.P. Just last summer. You always have to learn from what you do I

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
was interviewed by Al Sharpton the other day and I've known him a long time because I

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
represented New

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
York and he said and I think it's good to be reminded of this

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
that in the ninety's and particularly when my husband became

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
president there was a great

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
demand not just from America writ large but from the black

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
community to get tougher on crime and Al Sharpton said this he said I was one of those

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
people who was asking that we get tougher on crime and that we clean up

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
our neighborhoods and we stop gangs from killing each other he said I was you know going around

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.000
boarding up crack

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
houses and he said so we can't go back and say that we

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
didn't ask that a lot of this be done because we

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
did I think. What's important is you take stock of what was

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
done and you figure out what needs to change and what we have seen over

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
the course of now you know a number of

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
years is that too many low level offenders too

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
many nonviolent offenders ended up in prison

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and that became a

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
terrible strain and drain on the African-American

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
community because too many you know again predominately not exclusively

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
men were ending up incarcerated.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
So I think you know what my husband said when he spoke to the end of lay C.P. was look you

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
know we've learned a lot and you know tip took responsibility for whatever.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Impact of the legislation but also being reminded there were reasons why

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
that legislation was passed and very strongly support it across communities of color

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
and everybody

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
else in a democracy you're supposed to be able to keep being

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
a learning political system and now we've got to say to ourselves as people

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
are hey maybe there were some good intentions but

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
those intentions had unintended consequences and we've got to deal with those consequences.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
But it's not enough in my opinion as some on the Republican side are saying well you know let's

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
just change the sentencing and all that I'm for all of

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
that but let's also provide more supports in the community. Let's also you

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
know make sure that people who are diverted from the criminal justice

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
system have a real chance to

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
get you know the services and support they need to build their lives so this is now

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
think got to be a broader conversation than just you know change the sentencing and

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
you know move low level offenders out of the the prisons because that has to be done but

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
that's not enough.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Do you think that that answer is a good enough answer for the people of color who are

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
right now in jail because of the very very broken

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
system. Look most of the people who are in jail are there. Under state law not federal law

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
the federal prisons are very small part of the equation here.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
So you have to change the federal prisons which are going to that's why President Obama went to

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
visit a federal prison because the president really only has direct authority over the

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
federal prisons. We have to

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
change what are the vast majority of decisions being made

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
and local jails and state prisons in order to move this agenda

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
forward and the federal government can provide some incentives

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
like you know put more money into drug courts put more money into you know services

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
for people so that you can then you know move states in the right direction

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
but states control their prison system

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
so again that. That's one of those you know distinctions that needs to be made we've got to

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
change the policies at the federal level to serve as an example and hopefully to

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.000
provide

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
some you know incentives and disincentives

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
so more states also change their policies you spend a little bit of time as a young person.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Well a lot of time protesting against the injustices that you saw and now you are

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
aspiring to the highest office in the establishment. What do you think young

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
activists Hillary would tell a current Hillary or what advice would she have there's a role

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
for activism and I am a huge proponent of

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
activism and then there is a role for trying to translate the goals

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
of activism into results for people

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
so there is a continuum here. You know when I worked for the

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Children's Defense Fund. You know we were trying to change a lot of things about why kids ended up

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
in prison systems and why kids with disabilities couldn't go to school so we

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
were active and we gathered our information and we made our

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
case and then we combined forces with a lot of other groups and then we got the law changed

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
and you have to keep doing that over and over again they're going to answer the question. Yeah what would you say keep

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
doing what you can to look I do realize the goals that I've always had my entire life own.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Now I will be workin on them from you know a different

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:12.000
position.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
We are going to transition into our fun segment is OK Your daughter a few

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
pubes you that is our rapid fire questions that men with isn't actually rapid fire

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
good read it and I'm sure that you book your kind of print on I'm like OK Bill O'Reilly a

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
little more RAM please no air right. OK.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
First question

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
world are ruining this country. They are chewing through power lines

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
and causing power outages they're getting drunk inches making a mess that you are I have a

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
back to be so if you get in the story give people the plague now I think that's not a fact

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
that's not a moron with the plague. I'm going anyway

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
anyway. What are you going to do about this national

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
myth. Well I'm surely going to a lot of attention and I think it's important

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
that I'm for gun control but people as far as I'm concerned can do whatever they want to to get rid

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
of the squirrel body through power lines and getting drunk and giving people the

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.000
plague

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
on us announce he's going to be running for president two thousand and twenty if he asked you to be V.P. would you do it well

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I have to say I've told Kanye that I think that he might want to drop

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the ball he might want to wait because I'll be running for re-election I see I you know I

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
might want to try to give him some additional experience so he's

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
got all the other things he's done on his resume he's got you know some kind of

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
envoy role or something that he can point to but I would not rule out anybody for vice president wrong

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
maybe I

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
wouldn't rule out any kind of factor you to over thirty five and not yet I've got to

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
where you OK you're actually welder and so maybe by two thousand and twenty you would be so I wish I was

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
there to please. It is that. In preparation for this interview I watched a lot of your interviews.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And I noticed

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
you never sweat like physically not long enough not enough time is on the

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
planet we have been like a little bit oppressed and I get so

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
hot I mean when why am city. Like what is your deodorant Well first of all you've only

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
done a little bit when you've done as much as I What is your secret my secret if you

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
do it so often you didn't see me forty years ago when I did my first one I don't like sweat because you're nervous

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I just mean physically I felt that if

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I was there I had only curious what your deodorant if I well you know I just I just

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
turned off the thermostat you know I don't know that's not a spray situation it's a liquid.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
I mean I am not joking I'm sweating right

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
now I've got a couple of blocks at all and OK I'm gonna work on this this is an

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
eye question that I lobbied for a lad because one of my favorite questions to ask people if you don't have an answer

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
that's fine but I will be a little bad. OK What's the weirdest thing about

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
you the weirdest thing about me is that I don't sweat.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Yeah obviously that's not the artilleries I Robot. But you're also

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
what you guys are the first to realize that I'm really not even a human.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
I I was constructed in a garage in Palo Alto.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Exactly and I want to go down with oh think that you know Bill Gates and Steve Jobs

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
they created I don't even know. Oh no I mean a man whose name shall remain nameless created me in

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
the garage are there more of you thought

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
now you know I thought he threw away the plans at least that's what he told me when he

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Program me that there would be no more I've seen more people that kind of don't sweat and other

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
things that make me think maybe they are part of the new race that he has created

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
the robot race that they had a cyborg

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I don't you know you got that you can't tell anybody as I don't want to but I know this I made in the No one man in

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
your neighborhood how do you know you are Davenport Iowa and I just fell on my you

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
know electronic guts to you and without

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
any better than this you imagine if you're a friend yeah we let's why I have to wait till the end of the

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
day what I get on reparations and how

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
soon can I expect my check and I got time that affect my everyone

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
into what's good.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I tell you what I think is we need to make many more investments in.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Everything from preschool education to affordable housing that's my form of you know trying to

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
give people

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
the the chance to be empowered to make the most of their own God given potential that's what I believe

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
so you talk about like Nike in the sixty's and I just I don't think either one of you will probably need it

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
but you know you never know I'll try to get

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
a system to jail my banker if you don't follow my summary right.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
We're your good your fans the good wife. We are fans of The Good Wife huge fans. Yeah life is

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
it hard to watch a show that's like borrowed so heavily from your life. I

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
don't see it that way but maybe i'm just be

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
a lawyer who has no error who had heard it and there was there and

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
that's Falwell and yeah look I like the acting and I

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
like the outrageous plotting and I keep you know standing there hoping

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
that something even more outrageous will happen because then I know it's not about

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
me because I think you know we're going to Iraq comes right down to

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
like every character leash I mean you know she's

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
ever character word. We're going to trial because we just want to sit in to chat

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
for ever but we're being told by our producer mommies that we have to wrap it up. And you should

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
always listen to your mommy that's what I tell my daughter all right and I always

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
I can't believe this is happening and I can listen if you sit down and let us in as much hard to it

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
enters the time make you guys good luck to you how was the I love you been doing

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
this six months is that all together are great team got to go good

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
but real and go a little interesting will I don't think my team out a under their own thank you so

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000
much.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I can't believe we did that beginning that I can the less last I'm around. Yes

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
hackles Maybe Yes Who are you going around for three hours than around for the entire

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
cast of the Broadway

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
play Hamilton blue it is so good to get a what is it I want to go see it on Sunday.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
And like I didn't listen to any of the music before I went to go see it and I'm asleep I was really

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
skeptical about is like a hip hop musical about Alexander Hamilton of all people

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
like best not going about control a reason to be skeptical of money but I love history and

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
literally everybody in my life has been talking about it. Yeah right through me go check it out that the

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
songs are really really

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
good Thomas Jefferson enjoyed Washington had bars

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
and easy enough. Things Larry know I live alone and know amazing and the crazy thing

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
is that like when we were watchin Secretary Clinton earlier today and

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
she like had she had the microphone on one hand and like the other hands doing like politicians

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
and the kind of like rapping and I like you know what

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
I see so I don't think I see why this happened because politics really is sort

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
of like a hip hop battle kind of I'm the best right. This is why you should listen

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
to always me out with the winning team and I'll meet this group over here and let me break you know why

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
the nation. Yeah I

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
get it. I really get it all followed him back to the good wife Renee at least go bury

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
who played the black lawyer that Kerry like had a fling with. Not only they didn't go wife

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
but Kerry Superfriends though that's what I think of when I think of my character because I'm jealous.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Anyway she plays in jealous of Kyle and like watchin the good

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
wife I was like How can you like things this way you know like it's after hearing

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
how good she sing. And just like you the whole time you have I'm a good wife have

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
my music the good life. I don't

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
know yet.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
I think my favorite

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
moment with the freestyle battles with Wayne Thomas Jefferson that freestyle

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
basically But the hip hop battle they had to have that was the song I missed everything and Alexander

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Hamilton so good to you know I hear you. I hear that it's great. I

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
just have no movies on because it's a completely weird thing but it's really

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
really good fellow cast and talk money and call it shits on oh my God I've been

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Femia

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
right Kathleen Hamilton if your. And come on the shell babies bought us a ticket or two

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
at least there. I don't it's not in my budget. So I guess they've got to go.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Heavily been

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
around for speaking of the good well if you guys know I've talked about the show a lot but

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I don't think I've bought a proper around for the good ones such a good show. This is how I pitch it to people because

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I am like an evangelical Good Wife

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
spreader great show with dope women they're always like

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
flies fuck the outfit game is on point every single one of

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
them people who like big from Sex And The City that's a

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
draw Carey who is Rory Gilmore is best boyfriend I would argue

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.000
even though

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
that's a very hotly debated thing. Eleanor is not feeling it. Our producer is shaking her

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
head and obviously the protagonist Julianna

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Margulies aka Licia Florek is a boss ass bitch. I think it does like a good

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
job of talking about like being a woman in politics being a woman at work. There's a lot of race

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
stuff in it. Obviously my favorite character is Kalinda

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Sharma R.G.P. jobby so are the fun job the on The Good Wife is like the only

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
character on T.V. Besides maybe the Broad City girls that I would identify as

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
properly queer like they take great pains to like not particularly say what her

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.000
sexuality

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
is and she kind of dances around it but not in a way that's like I'm closeted just more like this

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
is who I am so like she just like an unreal character in the T.V. landscape.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
But she's dope just on all other accounts also her leather and like game is long pointed

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.000
out

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
away. But I am very very very upset

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
that they have not let her go on to season six

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
like her story ended and what is the deal behind that all these gossip

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
about her and Julianna Margulies like having

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
beef. So that they didn't even shoot the final scene they had together and I

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
normally don't care for this kind of beef. I'm like you know what the fuck happened when

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I really love our human Dobby and for her to be short changed like this it was like it was really bad

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I love The Good Wife but I really really do not care for the

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
way her character arc has developed like the last few seasons. That doesn't sound like

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
an endorsement but it is a very

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
good show it's a really good show all you know I don't watch T.V. So yeah it's one of the only shows I

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
watch as it's airing because they do take care to be

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
topical they are going to have Season seven going to have Hillary Clinton as a

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
character. And like when

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
the primaries are happening they're going to the primaries on the show so shout out to Archie

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Punjab me I love you come on the

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
show

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.000
and that's
