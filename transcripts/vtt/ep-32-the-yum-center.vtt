Support for another Ron comes from square space.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So once one time I had this I technically still have a website. I just don't tell people to look at it because

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it looks like not great and it looks not great because I didn't know what people who knew what they

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
would do like Claire's

OH MY GOD I'M

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
SO EXCITED FOR THE SHOW TONIGHT Jesus why why why we are going to lower the hat once.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well bred and have been when it's lost the old mortgage by which

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is something I want to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
share it with us and then we're going to interview Melissa hers then

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
when so as you may know she has an M S N B C show she's a professor she's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
like I was in a million things I don't mean that in the ME I WAS LIKE her braids

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
always yes I had a lot of I'm very excited doctor about that yet.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So let's get going. OK I saw that from

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Brian fellows.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Although it's true isn't it. Let's get going.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
what

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.000
happened

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.000
was

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you think earlier this week I was you know walking minding my business living my

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
life as you see as I am want to do when I saw the most

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
horrifying combination of things that you have ever been combined on top of the wipers and said Oh

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
my God this is. You know when you're

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
like New York City like people watching or like on the subway you're just like oh wired or

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you hear at this time. What are you doing where you go you know it was just story. So I was like walking but

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it was more of like a stroll I was looking around. Into

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
my front to my front in front of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
me was a low low gaggle of white

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
people gaggle the second favorite unit of measurement.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If you listen closely to the show's Cracker Barrel. So there's a whole

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
gaggle they are just like twenty something white people and under the spotlight of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the street light snow and ice.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
see one one very long

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
dreadlock

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
one. I understand he did one day last he had one.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So I look up to the head and from the light and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the angle.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It looked like he had no hair. Wow So then I gasped.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because I realized what was happening. This is a man with the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
combination dreadlock rat tail.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Well yeah I had a really long catalog.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But it was like at the back of his head

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I shud i like I want to get

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
closer with it like blonde I was a little yes. And he was completely about at the last.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yes. So I was like oh this is like spotting a white

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
dude with dreadlocks in the wild. That's like two years

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
about luck. Not a white man with dreadlocks in the wild come

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
by with a rat tail

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
didn't dreadlock Redtail a dread tale. No no.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I read last. I got like seven years

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
of bad luck.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Damn we got a thank you to a priest

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is to get you out of this somehow so the reason I said get. I go

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
because like I feel like why people haven't evolved a squad yet. And

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the reason I say this because if you have real friends maybe like

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Brett not good luck for you why are we still doing this you can tell you had it for a while because

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
of a long ass travelogue Maybe it's like

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
a religious thing Larry thank you everyone and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm I just really want to share that with someone to get a picture. No I

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
don't like to creep shot people. Well you document the bad luck that you would counter live and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I mean your job to prevent me this knowledge

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
so that the final isn't kind of like reversal ritual for the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
leg leaves you don't like or like ready to leave e-mail is another my God I mean I

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
think the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
sauce will be gone by some say he is by birth and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I thank you for listening guys pray

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000
man.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So we are excited to have Dr Melissa Harris Perry on the show today she is the presidential endowed professor

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in politics and international affairs at Wake Forest

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
University incredible She's the host of M.S. N.B.C.'s Melissa Harris Perry airing on the weekends.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
She's the author of Sister citizen shame stereotypes and black women in America

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and Barbershops Bibles and BT everyday talk and black political

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
thought. You also like a columnist at The Nation and writing at Essence

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I honestly do not know how you do all

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
these things that are hellish al that if you make your biology.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Welcome to the show they do it judge in the little excited to be here

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
as will be a lot of fun. OK So we like to start all our interviews what are you doing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
why man. It's funny because a Friday is kind of a

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
weird day to ask me what I do. So we're recording

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
this on a Friday on a Friday I feel like I'm a television host because it's our day when we're

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
probably crashing the hardest for the weekend shows but but then I always say that's not my real job.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
My real job is being a college professor

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so I guess the link. Between being a called recess or being a T.V. host is that in

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
both frameworks I try to be a

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
teacher and I don't just mean a teacher like I have all the information and I am

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
here to convey it to you and bless you with my wisdom and knowledge but rather because I

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
like the I tried to model the best teachers that I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
had so for me the best teachers I had both taught me new things I didn't

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
know but then often would try to draw out of me things that I didn't know already but didn't quite

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
have the language for and so I do try to think of my classroom at Wake

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Forest and my big classroom in nerd land as being just kind of extensions of the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
same effort of being a teacher.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So why I think I've always felt called to it even as a kid I was the kid who

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
lined up the dolls and you know played schools kind. I also used to

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
marry my black Barbies off to job aka but

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that's

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
only about having ideas I had yes and that he

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
was tall and brown you know the kind was like ah the American

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yeah you do

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
you want the Chinese that you want to ride with you Mick I'm I just want

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that detail.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
You know so it really does feel like the calling my dad is a college professor his twin brother is

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
a college professor when my mom and dad met my mom was the graduate assistant for my

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
dad's class.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So I think teaching is a little bit in also just kind of what all of us do

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it makes me very excited that there's a brown woman with like braids on T.V. Leanne.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yes my God what is left and so I

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
know broadcast people have to deal with a lot. Wherever like serious conversations about what you should do with your hair.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I think there are only serious conversations now which it is a well.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So literally this week was my take out all the braids and the put

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
them all back in two days so on Tuesday when I was hanging out with my hair.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I like Instagram to picture of my. I hair and there was a little bit of

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
like you're not planning to like. Wow I'm

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
on that how how do they express right now

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is photographed. Are you making a change in

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
your life oh my God that's like

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the professional version of your grandmother than legs or you know I

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
don't go out like yeah right. I'm going try to go out and actually I will

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
say one of the people who also a couple things one I got very very

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
angry post Ferguson I thought a lot think a lot of us did and I needed to express that

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
rage in some way.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And so on the on one of the worst nights of.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Police action and I was watching it on air dropping the nose off of taking my braids

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
out and so I said to my husband.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I'm not putting them back in I'm going on with my I'm doing it and he was like I

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
know you are very mad. Right now but on Saturday morning at six am when you

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.000
have

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to do your hair you might feel differently. Why don't we do something different and

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
so that was when I put the blonde blonde streaks in it was like my

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
my radical anger

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
for Ferguson street. I think I don't think you know says that I just needed something

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that was like expressing like physically my irritation with what I was

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
seeing in that moment. And so that's really the only reason I mean I don't actually get that much pressure build

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
a reason I don't wear my natural hair an error is just

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because it's effort still a lot of it came in when I travel back and forth and raises it's

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
very easy and I think at this point you know I think

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
most people who are presumably my bosses in most of the places where

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I work have just kind of figured out

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that Melissa's kind of Melissa and they tend to like one of the things

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I've really learned from from watching Rachel Maddow over the years is she is

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
one of the people who very purposely creates a physical appearance that

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
is non distracting so that you are thinking about what she's saying. And

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
there's no question that at some point. I will take my hair and my hair and is also no doubt that no one will

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
have any idea what I said on the show for those two hours. Like you know that they're only going to respond to what's on my head

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and not with that man the worst part to me about

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
like fresh like newly getting your braids done is like hours of small

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
talk yet to deal with if you're not a regular Braider you know this is

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
not your regular Look you just like you know like when they go to market

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and yeah yeah single person you meet the other you literally have like my Where did everybody

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
go along to know that. Yes that was funny.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And there's also a little bit of

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
a judge because because usually it's how long and the next question is how long is that last question

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
is do you wash

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it. When I

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
asked the Juarez question that a body could ask me that my hand like

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
it was yes.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
How do you do yeah you know I mean that all beings are

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
like nobody would ever ask anybody else a very odd question but it's part of the navigation

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
of American life as as black girls and so there's also there's

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
also a way that that allows us to bond with one another because we navigate the world in that

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
way having a white mom I have often said that my hair has been part of

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
the salvation of my identity because I have real regular black girl hair. You don't

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
have the flop

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to say you know I think that I have.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Is not the kind of

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
white girl that my Mommy is like also sort of a fro situation

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
happening so. I've always felt like all those hours in the chairs

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
or those experiences with the hot cocoa more the birds of the like that's

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.000
also

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
just helps to be the McAbee Larry of how we talk about who we are yeah yeah

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
definitely you are very very good at having very diverse aka

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
brown skinned guests on your show which proves that it is possible to

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
have a new show and include like all the talking heads of all it is why again.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So you're good at it why do you think everybody else sucks it is so

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
much we are good at it for two reasons three reasons one.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Michelle combo.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
She's my senior booking producer the amount of diversity that she can get into four chairs is

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
kind of extraordinary because part of it is racial diversity.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You know she she wants not just black and brown people she wants black and brown queer people

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
some of whom are short some of whom were tall full of rule from the northeast some of whom are right handed I think you're right like

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
yeah she was all right she was in four

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
chairs but the second part of that is that all of us are extremely aware

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
of it is how we build our tables all of us working on deadlines and timelines that are very

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
brief and so we're all working from the Rolodex of who we know and I mean for us sometimes it

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
means that what Melissa will suggest is a table of my

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for for having that topic we need the ball of law and guess what all four of them are African-American

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
college professors there right and so my A.P. is like no we're going to

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
diversity but and in this case diversity means not for black college professors talking about it

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
right but it is because we can look at a table and at least start to think about who's not

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
there who should be there you know I don't want

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to say with other folks I got it but I will say that the thing that makes it possible for us to do

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
it is that we think about it all doesn't happen accidentally It's really purposeful

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and awesome because your work exists in like the intersection of

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
like academia public

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
discourse last year Thomas eco it's called you America's foremost public

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
intellectual It was weird and people lost

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
their shit that was very tall like political. But

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
he was he was

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
also clearly doing that just to be provocative like you know. But you consider

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
yourself a public intellectual I guess I would think of myself more as.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
A public scholar than I mean I think intellectual carries with it this like I have patches

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.000
on

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
my elbow. You know smoking by the side of the pipe so we're

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the kind of culture present my dad is.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Always funny to me the only thing I ever make is

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
ideas like I can't make you a widget or draw you a picture he can't like I you

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
know all I have is ideas and intellectual property so and I do it in front

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
of cameras so I yeah sure

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I don't know the foremost is weird because I also I also think that like that hierarchy.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You know. I love coats a lot. Sure but I also feel like sometimes you

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
get stuck in frameworks that are very

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
masculinist speak on their Yeah and so that notion of like a for most of the

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
hierarchy of the one person who's at the top that's very like to Boise

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and framework for thinking about how public how intellectual life. Yeah yeah and

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I just nodded so if I am America's foremost public intellectual I would only want to be for one reason and that

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
is because I have a table with four chairs and try to bring all the other folks

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
so I'd like to think of myself as like America's foremost convener of

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
all the other intellectual or most can be VERY doesn't have all you know it does that right.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
But you can see how political would be less mad about that political of

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
a

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
political I kind of want to get back to that point about masculinist models

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
of understanding stuff like this I don't know how else to describe it but there's a lot

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
of intellectual dick swinging from black male

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
academics swinging a measuring lane laying on

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
the table anyway I can dig saying now unrequested sell

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
the holiday meaning. How do

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
you deal with it and what has your experience

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
been like I've had good and bad experiences around that I

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
have two senior colleagues who I like to say. They're

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
just profoundly distinguished in my mind because they

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
they carried me

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
through through the academy in a thousand ways but never ever ever once.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Treated me like their daughter or their date but just always as they're here. My

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
colleague Michael Dawson and the late Manning. Marable.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But yet look you know I

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
guess Blackmon are reading a tradition

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
that tends to think that men's ideas are the most valuable

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
ideas and so I could see why they would think that they are because it actually takes kind of like booking a diverse

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
table takes a lot of

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
work to go find the girls and writings that we wrote and said and thought in order to

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
recognize we're actually being influenced by Wells and Cooper because you think you're just

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
being influenced by Dubois but we don't realize that you boys

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
go right in editing influenced by Wells and Cooper because we don't tell that part

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
of it for example as Nicole Hannah Jones say that's a big

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
well. Done to

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
go sell earlier today at who had it out on the another

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
round Twitter account where in the studio its military is paid as they might have any

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
questions or a lot of people had questions about

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
the Rachel Delaval interview getting all my people hate me really

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
bad I was wondering a lot

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
about what. I hear that much about it. Well wait what happened.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yeah well.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So I read it all in one was our friend

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Rachel emerged into the public space and I found her fascinating

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and most

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
of the rest of the world who I think thinks of themselves as being in solidarity with me and

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
my viewers and like my people were not thinking she was interesting they

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
were thinking she was dishonest and evil and

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
terrible and I think in part were looking for me to both cosign that and

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
to give voice to it and I just it's just honestly not how

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I experienced her personally or how I even experience the whole

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
event. Now I have come to think over

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
time part of what was happening that I just didn't catch.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Initially with who light skin privilege situation. So this

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
is the privilege problems I. Usually I'm pretty good about seeing when life.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Privileges operating. But part of what was happening when she was making a claim on

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.000
blackness

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
is she's making a claim on blackness from the end of the color spectrum in a very

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
particular space. So the language that would happen about. Well you could just step out of

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
blackness whenever you want part of how I would respond to

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
that was well spoken lots of light skinned people they can out

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
of like passing is also part of

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
what happened in the world and actually I think part of what I've come to

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
understand some folks actually were saying that they were like yup and all that is a problem.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Whoever she is personally right. And whatever those things

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
were I had a sense of familiarity with

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
her because she is from a part of the country she's from the Pacific Northwest

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
she's lived up there and Courtland Idaho.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
My mother has a white woman grew up in Spokane Washington.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
And I still have family members who live in Idaho and other parts of the country and

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I think that for east coasters for Chicago when far urban folks.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
It is almost impossible to explain why if you are a white woman with

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
black children. It is actually easier to just be a black woman. So let me just run through

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
this fifteen seconds here. Plaistow growing up in the immediate

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
post Jim Crow south in the one nine hundred seventy

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
S. in a household has a black child with a white

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
mother in Virginia in the one hundred seventy S. people expected to

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
see black

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
families in public space. So there may have been certain kinds of dangers

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
associated but it's not like a daily harassment just from being in the space

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
but when you are a white woman with a black child you are the actual walking

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
physical manifestation of

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
miseducation which is of course the entire discourse around lynching

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and Jim Crow and all of those things. There is a way in which there's

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
actually greater invisibility. If your family

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
is Mana racial.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I can understand why even though I'm not sure that is even

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
true of Rachel dollars all and I certainly didn't hear her.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Particularly articulate it this way but it. It was why I think I saw her slightly differently.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I could see why she would say that once she

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
had black children that passing into

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
blackness might actually be a safer space in which to

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
exist than to exist as a white woman with black children because in the public space that

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
is northern Idaho. Actually there is

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
a particular kind of public threat that emerges when you are a

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
walking example of miseducation even in twenty fifteen

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
so that was part of what I heard her say the other thing I guess is I was

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
disturbed by the number of people who said. That white

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
people cannot

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
experience the actual pain of anti-black racism that they can

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
only experience ally ship so to one more quick story I have one sister in

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
my family were mixed race family

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
but some of our siblings both of their parents are black and some both of their parents are

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
white my sister who is a tall white woman with blonde hair.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Both of her parents are white She's seven years older than me when I was five and

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
she was should be twelve we were out in public space and someone called me

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
the N. word I was five did not know what the N. word meant like it literally you

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.000
could have called

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
me you know box a Crayola that like I didn't get the word had no meaning to me.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
So in that moment I was not harmed by that word but my twelve year old sister who

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
is white was absolutely. She knew what that word meant she knew the threat that it posed that the

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
two of us alone together in that space were

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
being called that word and she didn't feel it as an ally towards my black

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
experience she felt as the sister of a black sister and she got into a fight.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And so like the I. DHEA that she could not experience racial harm is an odd.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.000
It's

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
just like what do you mean she can experience racial harmony of course she could and so Rachel doll Joe has black

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
sons one of whom looks not unlike Trayvon Martin and of her son was murdered and if he

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
were murdered under circumstances like the death

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
of Trayvon Martin why would we think that somehow because she was white she do I Well

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I mean that was just that black kid that died. I mean no she would experience that as as her son

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
having died and so. I

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
was distressed about our inability to imagine

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
the capacity of human pain

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
love all of that existing beyond racial lines because I just I just don't want black folks to

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
be essential is like I don't want us to

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
think that race is so real and so tangible that it would keep us from being able to

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
have deep human experiences that cross those lines then

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
is fascinating a very compelling theory it is but

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I don't know I mean that assume way yeah right. So that I think that the thing I've come to realize is that

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I was casting under so just like everybody else was casting all their stuff on dark matter

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
otherwise I think I was casting that narrative on her she's a net. Did I write

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
right that's what I was thinking certainly will I see her and I'm like oh girl I know you're like well.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So I mean she

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
certainly let's recast Rachel as someone

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
from New York someone who has no children who has no white black

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
children she just a random white woman who doesn't carry the same like

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.000
deep

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
connections on a statue for you she just the woman who decided that he was black one day.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
What do you think your opinion of her would

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
be you know I so I think that's different. Yeah I mean so because I think race is socially constructed

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
I think you have to go through the social construction right. So I don't I don't think that

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
my quite again

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
my sister is seven years older than me I think she was probably just this is

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
a joke she says she's like I know I'm white but I'm not regular white people.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
She just means like you grew up in a household with four black

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
siblings and it doesn't make you black right. She acknowledges that but it

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
also makes you somehow different in your life in worldview

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
and experiences and not just like more liberal or Democrat or something like it actually

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Schiff in part what she thinks of as

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
the world that she exists and that's because it's literally socially constructed. It's not

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
psychologically constructed like you can't just decide.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Oh and now I am like that's not a no you have to construct it through some set

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
of lived experiences.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
I remember after Rachel's story came out I decided that I was going to

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
identify as a person with the perfect credit score.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Yeah pretty tough I had not words I may think I don't know

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
how to make this happen let us reason here is my hobby identified as America's foremost public

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
and I look

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
at this how I feel about my background it just makes me much more relaxed about identity

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
theft trying to live life in good luck. What you want to be

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
doing things by the community. You can have my how you have let's see how far you get

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
with thank you for

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
taking this. I really wanted to ask you very quickly before we go to the next segment here. They

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
be they be you to fall on the

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
beautiful you came into your miracle by

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
surrogacy that is true. I remember

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
reading your beautiful and moving account of like the decision and everything. I'm very

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
curious as to what led you to write about it in the way that you did.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Oh my daughter sir

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
did literally Here's what happened so I have a I have a thirteen year old daughter.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
The only way I had her was you know I fucked my husband I was twenty eight I got

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
pregnant like in fifteen

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
seconds weren't that bad a rage. Yeah I mean like I went off the

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000
pill and I was pregnant before back what I could write down on the fact that you're twenty.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Yeah

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
it's Wendy's especially you know. I had like natural childbirth I don't even have a talent like

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
all the good. I was proud

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
and then I was with

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
a period of a lot of illness fibroids I think a lot of African-American

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
women deal with I tried a thousand different ways of addressing

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
it and ultimately gave up my uterus and. Hysterectomy and at the time

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
wasn't married was a

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
dating and my daughter was of an age that I thought OK I'm done right.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
If I remember saying to my father who was in his sixty's at the time I

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
said Oh I think I'm done having kids he was like me to us like

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
oh OK dad I didn't

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
know I don't know that now I was still open but

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
the struggle continues so and it is a

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
business to many things. When I

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
met the man who's now my husband who doesn't have any children of his own who

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
desperately wanted to have a family with me I was just like you know I know you went to Catholic

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
school so maybe you don't know how this works but really we can't have kids I don't

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
have either like really. I love the

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
loving say them the love of their

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
wages but I had kept my ovaries which meant that we literally could make our own

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
genetic child I just couldn't carry that baby.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
So James being who he is is like I'm sure there's a way and I was like Dude no for

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
really this is not you have to so we have a friend

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
who is he's Asian American his husband is African-American and one

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
of them is a HIV positive and they

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
have two beautiful children the a surrogacy and I said well if my you

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
know interracial queer HIV positive couple can have kids.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Hell yeah yeah. And so we kind of we started working with the

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
same agency that they worked

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
with fell in love with the woman who is herself married has two children of her own

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
her whole family including her sister her mom her dad were all there. When baby

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
nerd was born she went through quite a difficult pregnancy at the end she had a

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
big C. six is a

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
lot and so when I posted a picture of me and baby nurse after baby was

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
born because I had not been visibly pregnant. The world just presumed that I had

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
adopted and so my daughter's surrogate told me I was like yeah

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
well I was going to be

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
proud

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
like that as well as

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
the parent child for not on my own like anyone write about me so

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
yes you

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
dreamily private and I'd never you know but I was like oh wow this is I need to

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
clarify the situation with so. So in

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
part I wrote about it because it just is disrespectful to her and the sacrifices that she made

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
to make our daughter possible to allow it. The story to go otherwise but I will say just

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
on a day to day basis because in real life I'm not famous I just would walk

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
around with this two week old baby in my you

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
know Kenny tiny jeans and people that. Oh my God look so good I

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
guess I look back and all that credit I was a real

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
clear man to yoga. Oh

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
my gosh I wanted to do it

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
in addition to surrogacy I. Another thing that I've never heard black women talk

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
about is eating disorders. So there's this short like web series called black

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
folk don't. Yes And they they just had like some random fun topics to one of them was like black folk

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
don't have eating disorders you popped up on the screen

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I'm so it was at that time I think it's like two thousand and twelve

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
or something at that time I remember being like I don't think I've ever heard a black person talk about eating

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
disorders or like body stuff in that way. Yeah I was a raging bull lemak at the end

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
of high school going into college. What I now know is that a

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
substantial number of bully makes or people who suffer with blame your

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
are survivors of childhood sexual assault as am I I just I didn't understand

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
that connection so at the. I was watching After-School specials and I thought that I was going

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
through the Believe me a situation because of some situation I had with my

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
body but what I realize now is that the things the weird things I do with my body almost have

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
nothing to do with my body except that I was I was raped at

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
fourteen by a neighbor and I didn't tell for about a decade and so the

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
eating and then throwing up and or the eating and then the running it off part of the

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
reason that we don't talk about the eating disorders is because we don't talk about the sexual assault and so.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
You know again if we kind of go with the after school special version it's this idea that the

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
reason that women start to manipulate their bodies is because

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
of like Ozmo magazine or I guess that I mean it exists in the world it

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
certainly impacts. US but we also know there's a ton of research saying that women of color actually

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
don't experience like that complex feel

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
your complex in the same way

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
we have a black man live a

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Gas prices are going to

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
push our selfhood like they had a normative game some dude's I

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
don't know but I just think it's more that literally we look at them were like well even if I didn't eat for a week I still would look

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
like right. Like all of

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
the things are don't match up there but for me it's really like

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
the desire to control the body is because some point your body was taken out

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
of your control by some person who meant it

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
harm as a person is always in the public eye. How do you deal with

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
criticism like a few looking through your top Google results. Like I want pages

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
deep but like few top ones are like Breitbart or.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Some conservative Web site that doesn't have fact checkers.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
That is like we got her. That's one thing.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I do not deal with it well at all

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
at all and it's it's interesting because I have colleagues who deal with it

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
really beautifully and I'm always looking for tips from them. My favorite person is.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Al Sharpton like there's really nothing you can say about Reverend Al where you

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
like and you know maybe it's just the many years of it or maybe it's

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
just sort of how he sees himself or maybe it's

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
his general sense of self in the

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
world but I'm a mess behind it and so it's interesting because

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
it shut off some faces I used to really enjoy So some of my so my best friends I met

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
in

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
early Twitter in the you know two thousand and eight nine era and I could never happen again because

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I do not read my replies. If I'm being attacked and I feel like I'm being attacked and

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I didn't do anything

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
wrong that can feel bad but OK But if I feel

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
like I am partly to blame for it either I said something on

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
air that I don't actually believe but I got caught up in the moment

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
or like recently you know I'm I am literally bad with my money and

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
then I'd had a rough two years and then all of a sudden you know my

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
personal financial situation became a news

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
topic and one that then sucked in other people and harmed other

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
people and I was not right from like when I say I was not right of not right

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
for months and every time I went on air after that it was physically

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
painful. I'm not good at it will be very happy when.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
All T.V. shows and someday my T.V. show will and there will be a lot of things about my T.V. show ending some

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
day that I will hate and I will

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
miss I will not hate and miss the

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
days when I have to go on and say words when I would like to say no words with you know just

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
you don't you don't have that option to say nothing and

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
always is fine overall but mostly I stick my head in

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
the corner but no literally no one no one wants to hear that so I've also learned it like complaining

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
about that will get you the row sympathy because. Because

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
an enormous privilege to have a national platform to say what you want and part of the cost of that is that

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
people will come for you and they don't come for you the way they did I do

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
wells they mocked me and made me feel awful but they didn't

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
like actually kick me. Out of my house. Or threaten to kill my husband or make it impossible for my

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
child to go to school. That's what they did to all the other black ladies who said words about what

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
they believed

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
in kind of all the rest of American history so fucked with her.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I mean. So what is the self care routine do you have

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
one summer runner which is more about. My

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
brain chemistry anything else so it's like get out there and feel better I have an extraordinarily

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
supportive Ed patient spouse and so a lot of my self care is

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
of

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
me I do opt out when I need to but also I

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
think probably the main self care thing is. I have a

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
huge network of

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
people you know my show is me on T.V. but it's twelve brilliant people

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.000
who are making the

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
show you know the image of Lou Cooper center is sometimes just me out front but it's

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
actually my team of four people you know my students are doing

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
incredible things but is that like so even my household is my mom my sister

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:18.000
the kids you know James I have enough sense not to try to do by myself.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.000
They

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.000
are

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Al and like Happy Hour like a networking mixer thing or whatever

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
and somebody right in there like oh here's my card take out my website and then you go to their

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
website and this like

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
is China and I know you've already got you know they don't.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So if there's a a girl

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
felt that what this person is probably know it's probably smart but their website sucks and they like I can't have your

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
my life. Here's a great way to avoid that everybody Squarespace

Well who doesn't like free stuff I do. Everybody does yes you're right you're right.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
So start every track today it's GREAT say that come when you sign up use Africa have another

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
round and get him percent off your first sergeant who doesn't love

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
getting them for some apple stuff and who doesn't love sharing that they love another round. Come on come on so

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I am too and one

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
who would want to wear things build it

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:51.000
just.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
So we're going to switch gears a little bit and do some fun and rapid fire questions and

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
that rapid fire and off the top you see the finger

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Good luck with this is the first question people get really upset at us when we

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
don't ask our guests how they feel about squirrels. How do you feel that girls.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I genuinely and generally like squirrel

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Oh my God I. This isn't the little bit of the white

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
part I like a lot of random animal.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I love that you know you know what you're right but I

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
guess if I walk around barefoot and I like lots. I do I walk around barefoot

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000
a lot into the men like I had the you know the math that she's done a lot of.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.000
OK

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
OK OK. One of my one of my friends came to stay in the apartment that we have

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
here in New York. She calls and she says you don't have an iron here do

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
you know I was like you know she was like you are right

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
so

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
why am I OK but what other

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
random animals. This is right up my alley. So I feel like this interview happened in part

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
because of a tweet I put out about the chicken

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
coup. Did not

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
happen. Our producers are not little I want to meet

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
a chicken salad

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
and I write a check when I move to North Carolina one of the things we did was to buy a house that

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
has an acre and a half of land and so I've turned into a bit of a backyard farmer and I like I live veggie

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
garden stuff but I am dying for a chicken coop I have many feelings about my desire

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.000
for

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
chickens My husband is not down and I got a divorce have made a lot of like well

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
so in New Orleans we had chickens but they were free range Seventh Ward chickens that had gotten free in

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Katrina and they were a little lazy it felt like oh my God you know why did the rooster

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
the rooster would like crowing like ten

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
fifteen cents like Nadal and I are very well very

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
ridiculous so you might want that chicken but just like wander around we can have to get

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
a responsible

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
for the rules would only make so much interest do you have one jobs

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
or seventy

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
seven toward free chicken video myself not worried about your not about that

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
life can I make an outrageous request if and when you get to take time to happen.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I'M GOING TO WITNESS Oh yeah existence. Will you name one of them after me.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Oh my oh no I'm getting three chickens I'm naming them Shad wrecked me shack and

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
then. I

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
guess it's OK I'll just get

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
mileage on it's fine. So you teach a lot

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
of African-American political classes the intersection

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
of those thing.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
As we know black people in college they kind of you know have their low

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
awakening sometimes and sometimes maybe doing the

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
most was easy but did everything you ever want to tell your students alike or a child

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
but no I but I do tell you I was very.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
It's so you know you know you guys want to ask me a thousand questions my thirteen year old would

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.000
never like to hear me

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
speak again. You know. She's thirteen and she

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
hears words all the time so my few Cubans are funny because if you go and ask my

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
students like oh you know this must be so incredible I have radical black fantasy like sheep

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
that

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
you know in my experiences with them I'm constantly lie. Oh

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
you. You really can't like the crazy recognizes

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
the I'm not going

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
to know if you can

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
talk to to to my dean from when I was in college he will for

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
my view that I had maybe done a spoken word. Oh no

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:53.000
not here not where I had maybe suggested that I might be fascinating.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
But you

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
know incredible. Please tell me you remember this poem

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
called Any having I do I remember much of it I had so many let's be

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
clear he was African-American he is African-American. I just told

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
you he was a sellout to obvious

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
abolitionists what I enjoy is that I am now him out of their children

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
writing assassination falls right now my god guys but I love it because it looks that that is

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.000
what the work

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
of democracy is and I learned how to be who I am like by fighting

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
with and I'll say like my dean right now if you go back and he will tell that story

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
but he will also laugh about it and will see it as like a loving moment of teaching and

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.000
so

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I I hope that my students the ones who find me to be a sellout to

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
all the ministration I'm a good safe person for them to rage against because I actually want the

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
best for them and I'm not going to harm them and nothing that they say or do whatever keep me from still

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
seeking the very best and most equitable policies for

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
them so I was like please rage against me because I'm the single

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
safest like a thorough. I figure you can ever rage against but you don't do

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.000
the

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
poem though I'm not because just like a little bit. I'm not I

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
don't know. I have to damn it a little bit for

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
the autobiography someday the end

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
of this fire. So everybody on Twitter and by everybody on Twitter. I

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
mean like one person who asked a really good question. I want to know where you get your glasses.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Oh those glasses know me I'm pretty sure

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
government lives crap isn't so. Fair enough.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
It's like I have a lot of just about famous people have a lot.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I have an actual panic attack a Black Girls Rock and I like

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
it like like James had to take me out because the first lady was there and Jay to

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
pick it for me and I just like flipped out because I was in like a gap dress and I had a

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
feeling I have to I can't with actual famous people or sefl Oh so

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
what's with a lefty classes. Well that's great. Yeah let's grab.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
To it. What is your favorite ninety's R. and B. gym.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Oh my God I love them all. I love ever like

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
everything while I was creeping on your Instagram and I saw that you enjoy a Floetry com

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
site that happened I went back and really and

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
I had had a good.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Had I had a good time. And

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
then when she says that if somebody is playing Floetry it

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.000
is

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
not by accident in the hallways I was always part

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
of his I don't know I love it all. I mean I don't know that it's not the ninety's like in my car. It is the ninety's.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
That is what it was at all points on the body.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
That is beautiful. What is the most influential book you've ever

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
read the question. Well.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I live it already is kind of ridiculous because I mean there are many many

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
things it would be a great deal as an adult but like. As a child I

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
was obsessed with Charlotte's

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Web and I read it.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Aliya hunters. I will quote like I have feelings

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
about that book even today's how did it influence you part of it is actually my my very

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
best girlfriend the world. BLAIR Kelly who is profitable and. Kelly are with us

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
my best friend in the world and I always tell her she

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Charlotte and she's like Charlotte died.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
While our leg side although I never was there she's like Melissa and

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
then Charlotte died and left like eight thousand grandchildren. You're like this is the way I guess.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
But it's this idea

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
that I just meant that like you know I always identify

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
with Wilbur and like you know Wilbur is a little paranoid people coming to get him. And so he needs

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
somebody to build him up and to tell him that he's some pig and to tell him that he's terrific.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
And you know but to remind him that he's humble but like just like saying to him and stuff at

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
NIH and so he's dramatic and crazy

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
he falls out cries and it sure looks like well yes we

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
know it's about you're great and that that is

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
a role that Blair is played in my life like our actual friendship began. I was

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
breaking up with some boy in grad school and my response to having broken up with this boy was to leave

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
my door unlocked so that someone

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
would come in and just Although I think now as I gave it like to be able

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
to about four days like this is a farewell I got I mean we just did it

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
you know that's sort of the I think of her

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
as my Charlotte because you said she's exclusive writer and she's brilliant and well I love her

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
but the main thought she is like and then Charlotte died so

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
well bless her heart.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Milicic Perry please come back one day whenever you would

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
like there are also reasons to name into going

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
after me. You know that I'm down. OK I never said I don't have enough.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
I want to just want to think about where I mean they begin thinking

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
about where can people find your

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
work. Oh all kinds of places. My favorite place for the academic work

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
is and into. Cooper center which I think is right now it's that Cooper project

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
dot org. On the web if you go to Wake Forest and the imagery Cooper

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
center is where most of my academic work my FIL A by links to

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
the SR citizen book that kind of thing and for the T.V. show it's M H P

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Show dot com. Maybe if they want to follow you on Twitter. Even though. Oh yeah the Follow me on Twitter.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Sure everyone's while saying words I'm just not to read by so that's at N.P.R.'s.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Perry and the one place I do still I should tell the world but since I feel that replies on Instagram dress

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
there probably is social media. Well thought of also at interesting at Instagram were still

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
like you only like. To hate best of everything else

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
like

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
a great theater full sell follow Melissa on

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Instagram and thank you so much. Yes thanks for going through

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
anything

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
at and guess what we did it.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
We did it lead to the hole right now with that firm that's

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
from the thing. Dora the Explorer. Yes the mat. Oh my God. The man

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.000
one of our

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
listeners posted on our Facebook page that she played that song for her

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.000
young

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
kids are all kindergartners Yes she said it was you

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
know so shout out to you. Yes I should find that person have been who you been

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
around for I would like to buy around for Jane the version I hear so much about this show. It's

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
such a good show. I watched most of the first episode.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
You made it seem like you put a real effort and did it.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
OK So the premise is kind of wild so I get the

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
hesitation if you're just hearing the explanation. So the whole premise is basically

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
that Jane was like a young like devout Catholic and she's a

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
virgin and she's accidentally artificially

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
inseminated high jinks ensue and that usually back on from

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
someone how long can you keep this out.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
That's where I like like when I heard the premise of the show I was like. This show is not about her suing everybody.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
I did not identify with it so it's very elaborate and

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
like the only way I can tell I like the only way to describe it to people is like just like a Tele novella you just you

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
just have to embrace it and the go with all the stories yeah you have to like suspend

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
reality Yes Lee obviously if you want to win the village before this like I have it isn't but like I grew

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
up around like African

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
dramas. So that's good I went to him and I had enjoyed it not quite the saying you

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
know the Nigerian movies these Corey they're wild and it's always

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
like Beyonce and

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Solange like mad topical dancing and generally

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
just any way is the way

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
I explain my my joy about the show to people. First of all every single human in the

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
show is like incredibly gorgeous incredibly beautiful. It's Rudy it

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
really it's like and I'm a big fan of juicy gossip and

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
it fills that part of me was just like Who is this story go

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
and get me to see and so they have like

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
a really intense narrator situation because you have to have someone walking you through everything.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
There's no way week to week that you're like oh I remember what

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
happened when the wife of the person who kidnapped this one you know it's

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
a lot and telling a builder a lot. So there's a dope really funny Narrator It's basically

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
also just like a super heartfelt story about three

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
generations of Latino women. I didn't realize how much

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
I didn't see this on television. There's the grandma who speaks in

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Spanish but people talk to her in English and that's like how my household ran that's

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
mad common. If you're like an immigrant where you like talk to your parents or your grandparents in a different

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
language than the way they talk to you it's just lovely on that and

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
just like oh I don't even know I need it all but also at one point you'll find yourself being

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
like where is this drama going and then another point you're like sobbing. He went from

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
like wild to super earnest mad quick new

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
inquiry. I'm like

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
that in addition to like the immigrant thing. There's a character on

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
the show who's kind of like a small character. She's.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Jane's boyfriend coworker. She's a cop and she's also a cop very

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
tiny role but as soon as I saw her I was like oh my God she's Ethiopian.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And then I was like

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
whoa this is what why people feel like all

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
the time because this is like best case scenario from an Ethiopian American

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
person on a T.V. shows like I did not realize I had never experienced

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
this and that people experience this all this and

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
I know so I like feel very strongly about the show.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
It's like doing incredible things. It's easily one of the best new shows I've seen like the last five

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000
years collaterally was a big endorsements like doing a lot and we're not talking about it enough.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
So last night last night. Oh my

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
God so all the celebrities come to buzzy right there is one particular celebrity who

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
came that was Jaimee com You know I don't know how to

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
pronounce when I said that was the American that's right. Maybe everything.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
It looks like Jamie Jamie Kamil.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
He plays like a soap opera star in the in the show so it's like a soap opera with a soap opera.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.000
He is

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000
wrong and you know they love a guy that's very about actually and for us to

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
and

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
then he is south and so he has

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Gorges So I wrote like a appreciation process I'm like y'all were not talking about this man

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
enough and he saw it and he wanted to like personally think of me. So

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
he's fun and he smells great he's also really

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
on these powerful we mean without feeling I'm in

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
it so should I WAS MY NAME OF

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
version that's a Jane the version I want to buy around again ecologist the man

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
who you have got a job you have got to look

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
at with Janet.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
OK all day. I

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
mean. You know I have

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
one of John sure she's all right. I have a lot of names for

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000
her refer to her as the Iron Maiden sometimes

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
that you know my God. The center.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Let me explain the I'm sort of gone from lolo you think you're right in another world but I'm

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
lame from level can psyche and Yum Brands is

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
the company that owns like Taco Bell and K.F.C. and blah blah blah. And so

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
they get paid for our.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Because they don't have a pro ball team we have any pro sports team at all so college sports

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
are really really big at the university level as an arena. No is the center.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
So sometimes I come

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
out and I don't make sense than Or yeah I

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
think for now it's great what else do I call it.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
So the round is we're going to college. It is not your name a lot more

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
about Madonna for I think it got a pap smear this morning. OK you know

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000
as uncomfortable as it was for me you know speculum is an Athlon

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.000
president. OK so I was the like Madonna is like great but obviously you

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000
know obviously like I mean you could eat off my cervix also OK.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Yes some flags within braggadocio but yeah. Deal with it calm

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000
down. I know least to

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
gynecologists in the stories that they tell me about the people who come in to see them with like stuff.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Doc In the

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
end and just like people who just like Don't know how things work in

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
length

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
the situation. I

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
coulda literally not I couldn't it could just it just be me.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000
In addition to I'm sure they have more stories right. I've heard a lot of horror stories from my girlfriend just about like

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
that's the one job where you can't

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
be judged you cannot be did you not be judged you not be like a rough you can

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
be anyway and it's like I've heard so many stories of like. Specially

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
male gynecologists going wild outlandish things for women.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Wow. So I've had two male guy knows one was the worth of ever had one was

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
like so he reminds me of now I don't watch the director

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
regularly but he reminds me of the Low Country page guy.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
