00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.000

Caribbean paranoid shared by a

species going to change the life of these well for us and then we're going to talk with the would do book

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which I still cannot only imagine going to happen. So she's starring at N.B.C.'s The Wiz live which is happening

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
on December

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the still

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
feeling.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.000
All

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
right Tracy are you ready for this collection now this is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
just an example of a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
collective nouns like the unit of measurement. So you have a murder of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
crows this is so

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
beautiful. It's my favorite collective Now a water love thing but mostly that would be my favorite collectively a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
swarm of bees a more common one Yeah I guess the white people as and the like Cracker

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Barrel of trees.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You're going to have to guess which is right from the three answers I provided a multiple choice and I hope

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
you appreciate it. Are you ready. Yes All right so

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
a blank of ours is it a conspiracy of our luggage Aldrin

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of ourselves.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Parliament

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of our I know how you feel but I will wait can I just

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
introduce a bite of what has happened in my at least at a Parliament's about all of us I meant the album like powdered

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
wig. May already look like they're wearing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
no wigs. I think that conspiracy is used to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
describe Ravens conspiracy of ravens. So it's either

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
a parliament or a cauldron. I think out of a creepy

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and spooky and they probably practice witchcraft. But wow went out to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
be in a cauldron people think out there

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
smart smart thing off the new government

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
making decisions

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
on. What they're supposed to be because they think that there's my.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Parliament that is correct. I do anything logic that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Mark Parle Ideally they should be but here we

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
are good before my next run a blank affair

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
it's a shimmy affair is a flawed affair it's my guy

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
a business

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
affairs a business.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Shimmy flooded in business.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Kind of weasely moment kinda like booze little wiggly thing when they move on like Jamie

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Dornan of Le OK if you had like just like a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
shit ton of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
fairies just like running through a room it would probably look like what I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
write what I look like always I remember going in the shit ton

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of May you never be in a room with this

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
isn't fair to sounds terrifying or a business a business of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
fair it's a fair thing and the business

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that I'm in a month I slid the answer is

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
a business is there

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
in me and I imagine a lot of fair isn't like a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
business. No but it's Good morning

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Bill morning Bob I'm glad that should we threw you off it did

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
it did I feel great.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
All right next day it was a go an

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
OK a blank autres a romp of

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
water frolic of

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
waters a caper of otters Oh my gosh I went to bees frolic because a frolic

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of either sounds like the happiest thing in the world I know even to Jericho

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Sorry I don't know nothing about her.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Caper that sounds kind of cool bunch of ideas on a on

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
a caper like planet some high noon.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Well I wonder how do you feel so the options are a romp of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
waters a frolic of authors a keeper of water.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
A romp around feel like playful and stuff like go around violence or

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that is current right Chad I have to ask you.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Probably because the folks like me River from like is a collective noun for something

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
a frolic of black girls on the official

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
mind will fall with the black gold magic.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
OK next one.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
OK. A blank of journalists a gaggle of journalist.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Promote you to promote a flask of journalist.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Girland is saying is a day and there was a problem oh gee those are the crazy flows right off

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
the top.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
As somebody who pretends to be a journalist non-so likes to drink

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you put liquor in the flask and fill a journalist always drinking. The last there's a

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.000
right answer for

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
this and it is

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
well money and there are also a gaggle and a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
people there mostly. All right last

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
question Tracy in go blank of white

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
dudes

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
today. This is definitely a little dictionary this is

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
not. A start up of white.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Well actually of what I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
do or a shard of white.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So this

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is clearly a trick question because the answer is all of the of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
a that's an acceptable

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
answer was there actually one specific answer that you

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
think there wasn't anyone would have been right

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and brilliant. All right do you really well

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.000
make was I'm

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
in. Some reason to feel

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
sometimes

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
we're so excited to have a Stacy Maria Shellback for Stacy's career corner raising the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
ball as you all know she is the editor Buzz Feed news apps

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
both Android and i O S and you can find the buzz you knew that Buzz

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Feed dot com slash Tracy what do we got today for Stacey.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So today we're

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
talking things cover letters the things that you have to write to

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
convince someone to look at your

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
resume is no one to hire you. Well I mean you've nailed it right. I got

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
really annoyed that the first thing I want to like. Stacy

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
writes about hiring Bronson What did you think it was the was the what it was

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
about people I saw someone say career you know cover letters are useless in two thousand and fifty and I just lost

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
my shit like you know the wrong. The point of a cover letter is to help

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
someone understand why you are interested in this rule. What you would bring to the team if you

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.000
got this

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
rule and I was Tracy said exactly. Now OK that's good enough I'm going to continue this interview

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
process where. That is I will actually look at your C.V. whether that's I'm going to decide to bring you in for an

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
interview or a phone screen whatever it

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
is and so your C.V. is a like a way of selling

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
your value to the organization that is hiring you and the biggest mistake people make with the cover

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
letters is based on the same one to every single job that

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
they're applying Yeah I like definitely sometimes they remember to change the name of the company name but I've been

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
definitely gotten cover letters if I did that I think you meant to apply suppose

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
he find. Yeah I don't

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
like what I've noticed in hiring is that people kind of also just regurgitate

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
their resume right that I'm not interested like that I think that there's a certain point where resumes kind

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of blend together like you can't really tell one from the latter.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And why do you want this specific job. Why do you want to work for this team at this

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
company and it's not but you know I'm applying to work on the news up teams I'm really interested in television.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Like

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I can help you because there's objectively nothing I can do for

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you you know or just like I want to work with us because it's really cool.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Yes but like what do you want to

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
do what are you interested in you know what the and what do you knew about this team and this job

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
because sometimes that's hard you know there are certain jobs that you know they're out there and all the information they can possibly get

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is what is on the website or what the right job

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
description for other companies where you have lots of employees on social media to think about things they do

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
all the or you know there's been a recent interview with somebody. The person you'd

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
probably be working for

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
with the more that you can refer to what you know about the organization what it

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
stands for what its challenges are what they're trying to achieve that makes you a much more compelling

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
candidate than somebody who's like my objective is to find a job that is satisfying

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
you know. Where I can be a team player I

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
can say that enough like specificity is so important and really tell who is applying for this

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
specific job but I've also done that I've done it before

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
like yeah I'm going to say that I've ever been hired me thank God I actually like this is my two year as me as

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
my media. On this my babysitting. Yeah I mean

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the total power move is customizing your C.V. to match the cover letter to match the

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
job you know and that is I have looked for jobs it is incredibly time consuming it's horrible it's even worse when you don't

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
have one and you're trying to

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
get one of those work when you're in the middle of the recession like I was and you know it

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is really really hard but sometimes that little extra first thing that is going to mean somebody

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
is going to read what you have sent and you will get that phone call that you might not always have but how do you do that

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
for jobs

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that people are really passionate about.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I don't like how about you about jobs like I am of the prisons are you going to learn what you do like out of a

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
high class situation if you are loving what you do every like memoria or

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
two you know but it's you know it's a passion is often seen as like a defining

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
characteristic for me it's not it's interest. You know like do you want to do this thing like do you want to do

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
this thing well cool. You don't have to come to work every day be like the greatest thing that ever happened to me if

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
it is fantastic but if it is not it's a job and people deserve to earn

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
money. Yes people deserve money that

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.000
question

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
reminded me of a tweet that I was saying in Devon town I can't remember like exactly what I say that with and then like

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
so tell me why you want to work at McDonald's and the prices like I'm just really passionate

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
about inflaming the need so

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
many mixers can be delicious and when the machine works. So the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
big takeaways are specificity research research.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
How do you convey why you are suited to this particular thing it can

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
be hard to do that in your C.V. so the cover letter is a real opportunity to say you're asking for X. not only to

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
have X. I like. X. on steroids.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What is the most common mistake you see the most common mistake I

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
see is not telling me what you are interested in doing and or why you're applying for this

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
job right and so it's just as you say regurgitating the C.V. The second most common is

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
not proofreading your damn Colu when people spell my name wrong when

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
they're applied to the hiring manager and I are like well I don't I can't tell

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
you instantly. Failed to count when you're not a

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
thing or you know they miss you know one of the things about both feet is like capital B. capital

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
F. and so when people do the lower case of what kind

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
of offended when you catch those mistakes the like instantly throw those out I

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
things that you look at if you are applying to somebody to be a journalist and even their first point about location is

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
full of mistakes it's often a red flag.

com

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So we are very excited today to have those I would do that in the studio with

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
us starring in N.B.C.'s The ways live

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
on December third you probably know her as crazy eyes on orange and

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
black if you don't what's wrong with you when you know I really love that you laid everything she's

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
won all the awards. Most notably that you're the only actress to want to have one both a drama and

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
comedy Emmy for the same role and that's in addition to like.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Critics' Choice Award screen actor you know the

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
list goes on anyway it's very very welcome to

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the show. Thank you thank you

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
so much ladies for having me. So we like to start our show by asking everyone what do you do and why.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
On many ways he's a diva. I'm an actress I

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
know my name is a diva and I'm an artist. Oh

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and I do it because I have

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to can you elaborate on that a little bit like happier would NOT thing.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Live breathe inhabit stay inside my body. If I did not make

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
art create art do something artistic in some way. So in order for me

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to breathe I

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
guess I make art. That was poetic and beautiful.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You say in many interviews that the day that you learn that you got the role for orange the new black like

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
earlier that very day you decided to quit acting. And a lot of that was because

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
of the just like there's just like not a lot of roles for people who look like us.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Yes correct. And I was very struck that rather then be like

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I should to assimilate somehow I should be more of what these people want you was like nah I'm just

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
going to go be a lawyer you know like

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
yeah it seems that the thought of like assimilating or like changing anything about you was like never ever

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
ever an option and that you would never have

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
or not in my adult life. No I think

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
like the struggle. I mean whatever we live in a society patriarchal society

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
where their ideas that are thrust at us in every walking path of how a girl

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
woman is meant to look right. And

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that's why I was not you know insulated from

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that and then to layer on top of that I think the fact that

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I also

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
possess very African

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Future at a young age I went through those

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
wars as girls do and then I think I had that added layer of like

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Oh not only on my you know a black girl but I'm

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
also like Carrie all this other stuff with the gap and the the nose and the color the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
color and all this

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
stuff and. That really kind

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
of stopped for me. Somewhere right around

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
like high school. Now in hindsight I recognize that my mom

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
was constantly like she had

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
all he turned on me like was really like this thing you

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
feel is not correct. Like I must have been radiating off of me.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So you know I mean that's I was just like a teen tween right that was

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
years ago you said radiating everywhere radiating

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
really really tough and I was you know and you're like I'm not well enough I'm

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
too tall I'm not realizing like too tall. So you're going to be a model basically

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to try to go to all these things you know but you don't show appreciation for when

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
you're young. So what was the transition. Well for me I don't I just remember

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
like my mother for example with my gab. I want to braces like a crazy

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
person when you get a break because you know I just wanted them I kept asking constantly constantly fondly.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
She's like now and I remember sitting me down and she was

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
like Don't you know you have on your cool go up to her and made

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
my mom and him just like you have on your cool. She's like all the people in my family

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
think

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
oh I was the only one born without decision and in Nigeria adopted

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
this form of beauty in the form of with so. Free to close this thing is

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
for you to clean schools yourself from who you are. Don't ask me again for this

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000
thing like All right ladies that.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
You know and that's sort of the ice. That's not to say that like she said that I was like You're right

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
might not be right what's for dinner like you

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
know like it wasn't that

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
but it was she said that I remember I still had a

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
position on it but then I remember distinctly I went to get my senior portrait

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
pictures from high school taken the

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
photographer. I was just I have to do the work to find this man I just sent him a card because it like

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
really changed my life. He was changing. Still I'm changing ships whatever.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And we would be talking in between. Shots and I'd be laughing and be like

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
ah bright Smiley right like why you can see my gap and then as soon as he would point the camera shoot I

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
would close my mouth and have this

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
like some big smile on my face that was hiding my gap and I have so

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
many pictures of myself like that growing up where my mom would always smile smile and

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I'd be like that might be beautiful an idea but we live in medical Right

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
now you know and the so going back to the photographer he was like How come

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
every time you smile when I'm taking a picture you close your mouth like that you know

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I wasn't answering right away sort of being a little bit cagey and he was like

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
why why and finally I said you know I don't like my gap and he had his

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
camera and he was you know changing the film and he just said to me he was

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
like I think you have a beautiful smile. And it's not the

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
first time I'd ever heard that my mom had been saying that for years but

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
for some reason when he said it I heard it

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
for in a new way for the first time.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And it's not like that moment. Again I changed my smile because if you look at

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
here big picture it's a close enough

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
smile but I because we took those pictures the summer before senior year I

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
did that year I remember I just started smiling all the

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
time and should pictures like I just started smiling and I'd be saying I thought I was

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
like I have a beautiful smile. I could eat a full smile and so like now whenever I'm even

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
doing carpets and stuff like it's sometimes hard for me to likes

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
my feelings about like I want

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
to smile because I feel like I'm making up for lost Miles there are so many years that little girl did not

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
because she felt like she

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
was less. And she is not. She is just

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
as worthy and so no not in my adulthood I'm on the sort

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
of train and have been for some time now I refuse to

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
allow anybody to rob me of who I

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
am. I was beautiful at least. So I don't know if you've been watching as

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
these I'm sorry new Netflix show master of none. So there's this episode the parents episode.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yeah which is basically all about immigrant getting you know how you feel like you

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
don't even really know your parents all the sacrifices they

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
made you know my parents moved to a town where there

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
were very few people of color and when I say very few I think.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
The number could be counted on one hand not even you know one hundred people that's a

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
very few I'm talking maybe five families all

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
together at best and they all know each other absolutely they all got together and

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
we did always so they met in the

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
grocery store. My parents particularly my mother

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
fought the very very hard

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
road of ensuring her children's

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
safety and equality. These are people who

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
came from a country in the midst

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
of a civil war who were not about to let

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
their dreams for

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
their children be anyway railroaded because of someone's

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
racial prejudice. You know I mean that's just not going to happen and my parents also instilled it also a very

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
very clear understanding of who we are as

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
people and that you are not to allow anybody to second

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
guess or make you feel inadequate or insignificant in anything away just based on

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
the colors skin. That's not going to happen and I think that training.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I think my mom was exceptionally good at training our

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
community through her own level of confidence and strength that

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.000
it wasn't going to

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
be tolerated that everybody had to get on board. As a child of

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Nigerian immigrants like their have you like later as an adult like learn some like wild

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
stories your parents have gone through my parents have gone through I mean surviving a war.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Yeah well yeah. Yeah I mean

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
that's definitely in there right there I mean I mean my mom

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
has lived five lives that I'm not even

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
certain one of them the strength of ten men could survive

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
but she you know I learned growing up I remember my mom had

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
polio and. Yeah I was told she would never walk again she did

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I was told she was a cripple and that she would not be able to play sports not only do

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
that not true she went on to go and

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
play tennis. In college I went on to become the women's singles West African

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
champion

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and I learned that about her top story I thought was entirely untrue my whole

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
life fabricated until she came back from Nigeria with the truth.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I got I was like oh it didn't happen.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Those

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
are stories you know that's definitely stories like that and you start to

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
learn like about like just like the mountains that she's managed to climb on

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
that crippled leg. You're like wow I can't

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
even I hope to live up to be a tenth of the woman you

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
are was beautiful.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
I was researching some of your your athletic background you know you were a figure

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
skater for ten years correct. And also like a Star

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Trek track runner. Yes I ran. Yes I ran track and you know a single black person

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
goes figure skating that. I don't know either.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
How did you get into

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
that you know what that started. OK so my hometown I was

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I came home from school one day and I was a flyer you know teachers give you like flyers or whatever to like

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.000
your

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
parents I as a true Nigerian brought all of those

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
flyers home. And

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
diligently brought them home and one of them was a learn to

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
skate flyer which I brought and I was like Mommy can we do

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
learn to skate and she was like OK And so she put myself my younger sister me over.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I guess I

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
just took to it which I'm sure because my mom off to some degree

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
because she's like I have no interest in being in

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
the office. But

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
yeah we went my brother and I Chichi was like This is for the birds because she

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
was like I'm out but my younger brother always a teacher you know every

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
night you know yesterday I believe you know she she's a nickname though. Yeah you

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
know there's always a teacher just nickname was something yeah I was we have to thank God you

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
know something. Yeah. And so

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
my teacher who in our family is Teacher number one could be

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
something she was like I'm out but my younger brother and I really

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
were into it and I like the I just remember it was like

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I felt like flying like you could just

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
like race down the ice and

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
the speed of it. I like the adrenaline of it and the race and

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
the wind of the the the feeling of the win. You know like breezing past

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
your face and it's like a cold. I remember that feeling and then like being able to

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
jump always

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
felt like lift I don't know I just always had the ceiling of if I could fly. That's

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
what flying feels like well you know the only thing that's really

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
even come close I guess to that has never ever has been

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
acting and performing Do you feel like that a lot of background informs your

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
work. Great question in part

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I think the part of it while the physical element definitely in

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
my body I try to use my body in my work as best I can on

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
like feel comfortable in it it has definitely given

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
me a focus. You know like just

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
and staying focused and I think that's just in life being focused on what you're doing and less focus on

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
what anybody else is involved in you know one of my coaches in college she's to always say.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Stay in your lane and

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
then one day she you know she would execute a full and fight yeah you have talked about that advice on Ari

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Yeah

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
about staying in your lane and you know what here's the thing stay in your lane focus on your lane your job is not

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
to look back that's where you started your job is to look forward where you finish and you know that every single

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
time when you turn your head left or right to see what's going on with anybody else beside you take

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
a tenth of a second of your time now I ran sprint. I was a hundred meter

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
runner and say Miles a tenth of a second doesn't feel like

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
much when I was my coach speaking little bit like much but in

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
sprints a tenth of a second is the difference between first and last.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Write this and you're so

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
busy thinking about what's happening in the lane next to you are

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
giving them your race. Don't give anybody a race stay in your

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
line and I let's switch it up a little bit and talk about

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
this teeny tiny little live show that you're doing called the with the widow no if anyone

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.000
my

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
life to get out of well I was like I'm glad I didn't have

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I love that song and I also loved brand new day. I

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
mean how do you not start wanting to Alvin Ailey when you thought it was a movie.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
You want to you want to peel off that your costume and like to be. Yeah

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.000

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:59.000
that.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Like there certain things certain activities that you cannot do and be in a bad mood. One

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
of those you know I sometimes get it

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
high that excitedly. Yes has to get into it it's going to be.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
So you've done a lot of

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
amazing projects. No matter if you dream dream projects roll dream.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
I'm not sure if they're written

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
yet. What should we or I tell it for you. You know I've

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
always said and this has been my truth since I started in the.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
I want to tell the stories of the

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
missing. It's impossible for me to believe that when

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I flip through the pages of our history or our

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
president that. So many faces are absent.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
It's impossible for me to believe that even if it's a story we have seen before. Maybe the

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
intricacies of it aren't the same and I'm interested in seeing and

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
representing those stories of

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
loss interested in like what I've seen happen

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
before I'm more interested in the people and places I've never seen before in that order or

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
if it is something we've seen before done in a new way like again like like taking the with for

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
example this week everybody's going to see these

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
characters some of them reinvented and introduced in a way that we've never seen them before like we've never

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
seen a whiz as a woman played by Queen Latifa we've never seen this is.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
This is the Di Dia of glitter the good witch this is like the Queen of the south right like played this way

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
with Gap and all non-O. closed mouth miles happening there you know

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
that's I think exciting in that that's what I want to see happen. I'd like to see

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000
more of that more and more and more and more of that that's a. Fighting to me.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
So excited for the last reduction of the ways I feel like

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
not many people know that you seem like are a classically trained singer and I thought

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
even fewer people know that you seeing opera

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
you it was oh my god

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I didn't take the sleigh is what I'm going

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000

like the first the most

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
memorable saying. It was the first time because we went

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
home and in the village ability the you know our family was so excited that

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
we were coming. The kids that they

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
WERE THEY WANT TO KILL KILL KILL goat.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And because I've never seen people kill goat in real life yet and we were still too young

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
and Americanize the that sort of thing they made us all stay inside the

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
house and we were like wanking we don't like what's happening like it was a big you know sort

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
of affair and you could like I remember it's like almost like giraffe we're seeing the first

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
traffic part where it's like they bring the

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
goat just like a god yeah it's like tied to that she

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
doesn't like a

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
concept like that was basically what it was like a mound and there was like a goat tied up there all day and

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
then like suddenly we weren't allowed to play outside we had to be in five. We were all like trying to like looking like

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
the onset of. No And then like you heard like screaming billy goat scream and then like we

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
came outside of the earth like no go to

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
call but I got a very similar experience.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Oh yes I

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
see Koko Yeah. Yeah cow and sometimes cows sometimes

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
count them times I've seen cow films but we also know that you are very into The

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Real Housewives

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
franchise. OH MY GOD I'M ADDICTED What did you

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
have same a franchise in which I have a cast. That's like asking me who is my

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:40.000
favorite child. I have and am I paying for only his car.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
OK this is so tough because here is why it's tough let me explain to you why it's

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
tell because most people when they say they love The Real

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Housewives have like one maybe two that they watch so it's like a home only to be

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
between two. Yeah I watch. Everyone and like

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
wow. The only one I don't watch is Miami and the

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
reason is because I sell so far behind like it feels

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
like I would be writing it and I'm a very kind Yeah

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000
exactly like when I work at that sheet and I'm like six episodes times twenty.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
That's a lot of time I don't know if I have those one hundred hours. You know like yeah yeah. So

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
like let's be like clear I'm not

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
happy with that that to say that.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
My favorite is Atlanta New Jersey New

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
York I literally know why I'm saying this is

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
top of mind like OK here's the full candor admission this

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
past week. I have been working between orange and the was you know going back

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
moment been spent catching up on this season. I remember

I don't keep up with the Joneses I am

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
the joke. The land of Adela's

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
steps on New York where she says to Alex you know you came you came down here in

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
your home in Munster shoes and Alex says they were lose a ton and then very quickly

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
the Countess fires back will even Louie Vito makes mistakes.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
course pick up a

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
slab called the maids. It's a three hander which I'm really excited for.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
It's a very very dense play and it's not three hundred three hundred three

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000

just like some of these doors and then just let it get there when care about

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
you know what do you have

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
to stand and listen to all your doing this before

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
bill seem very functional anyway I'm very excited for the holidays

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
to but if I'm like you like you might want to

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
smile live music yes song I wish I would do it walk around.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
OK so and oh but. When one time when did you know

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
it didn't turn out very well for me so many of the

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
more nice long story when I had to get inside here but. Yeah I'm

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
excited for the cold weather and eggs and eggnog is the question about

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
a graphic novel such

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
a bad rap it is. Horrible I'm going to buy you a bottle of Evan Williams

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
money. I mean what I will drink what you want. I think I think you'll like it is so

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
good so well that I was around for eggnog around eggnog for

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
the holidays and you're creative. So you've been around for.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
I am buying around for soup.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And I love food. I would not expect my action.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
I do enjoy soup to I love soup season. Soup so like a

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
weird food because it's like. It can be mad like food. You know in the mad

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
liquidy

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
and chicken noodle soup is what people eat when they're like sick. Yes sometimes you need like a good chili.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Yeah you to lunch tolls. Out or no.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
One might say I would not be gosh. I feel like I don't even know you anyway.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
But there are just so many varieties I'm very impressed with what we as a people collectively have done

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
with soups. Do you have a favorite type

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
of you know I can't say very do. I hope it is so many do

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
you consider Chiles.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
What else is it categorically it's chilly. Releasing is

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
the I so we acted show my God this

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
is

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
an instant conversation because we in our chili my mother I was

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Pittsburgh getting old and chilling. So I think I think of it as like

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
a past tense in that respect

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
but if there's no noodles in it then you just have like the meat and like beings if you do beans.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Is there like the Seleka slurping situation happens in Chile. OK

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
this is

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I'm sorry I haven't thought that much I want to make a conflict.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
What I really like about soup is that the main aim is comes from the sound that

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.000
you make

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.000
when

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
you know so shout out to soup

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000
in all its varieties for being to get to.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.000
