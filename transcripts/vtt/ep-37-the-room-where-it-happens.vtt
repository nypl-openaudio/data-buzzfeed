So once one time I had this I technically still have a website. I just don't tell people to look at it because

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it looks like not great and it looks not great because I didn't know what people who knew what they would

Obama. This week is the last State of the union of the Obama presidency. So we have

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a lot to talk about and she's basically the person one of like three people who

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
are like the most important what I'm trying to take some notes

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000

Maybe she'll finally tell me what Obama's not.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You know I wouldn't ask.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000

So

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
before we get to the freakin White House which is a sting that is going to happen.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let's look

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000

He's pretty cool

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000

chairs dial everybody who lives. It's more of a.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It kind of is it kind of is OK I'm no friends so let me say it this way. OK

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000

So he and he comes to pick me up as he always says every year me goes to the mom

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and like he has very little patience for like browsing I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.000
was

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
looking for. I was looking for New Year's Eve

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
just like I'm writing this Asian Roque.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Miranda

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Oh in a generic Wiccan like this take a quick look around. He walked in with me a little bit he was like oh.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You can be airable

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I acted

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
out that language. Like I could see the good Samaritan and so he leave and he also had like

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
slight stutter which I sort of do too when I'm like trying to talk too fast and like

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
my brain has not caught up with my mouth

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
right and the stutter less the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the accident in just Plez being a

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
dad is what this man said.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
He was like OK yeah i'm just come to the phone just to

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
sound like a fake thing. Why people would say I'm a mind

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000

So we're very excited today to be in the White House interviewing Valerie

House Council on Women and Girls and she was also described in Buzz Feed as one of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the most powerful black women in American history.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000

So she began with little toes on yes yes thank you honey we're in with the Happy new year.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You are

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
here on the beginning of the second half of our fourth quarter and we've

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
had a pretty extraordinary week so well after the boring part in the

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
absolute wonderful job numbers today.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Already

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
more than all the music that's quite tasty. So the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
state of the Union is this week. It's the last State of the union of the

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Obama Mr I know it's so hard to believe it's going to end with like

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
a Mike drop is like you going to come out to the Crimean was like Serena. That's a real like

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
an idea like towards the end like as the administration is coming to a close isn't like a little

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
fairies clapping back a little more he's like telling people you know I

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
think you want to have power like water not cause I know

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I don't know

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
my my fantasy for this is you know mama to walk you know like a do rag

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and why what he's going to buy live or die she

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.000
can

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
relax the other thing you know can you love me like she has no i long after them gone

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
to hear.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I will say this to you and I'm not going to get out I had him on his speech but I

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
just spoke with him a few minutes ago and he really not withstanding that we have

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
been through a really tough seven years and I say we I really mean the American people obviously you know when

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
he took office we were losing like seven hundred fifty thousand jobs a

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
month and now we've had the other seventy eight straight months of

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
private sector job growth. We had a great jobs number. The beginning of

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
this month. So we've come a long way through some really tough times.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And he is so optimistic about our future.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So optimistic about our future now a lot of people they are here and

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
who would like this office and so optimism to the greatest country on her and

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
so I think his speech will really talk about our country and his vision for the future of our country.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
How involved with you where the writing and putting together the speech. This is a very personal one. So he's

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
spending a lot of time himself. We went to the town hall meeting that C.N.N.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
sponsored to talking about gun violence and what we can do to to end gun violence

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and when we rode back from that town hall he said he was going to stay up and really work on the speech itself.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So this is he really holds the speech and that's as it should be for his last

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
one while we're on the topic I do for a moment. Want to talk about.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Kind of frustrating depressing conversations about gun control. I mean I say that

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
because he's been emotional He's been angry he's in Stern he's

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
unpractical children are like all over national headlines in

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
like incredibly tragic situations and I'm curious what would it take for

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
change to well happen this

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is the perfect question. And as he said when he gave those

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
very emotional remarks last Tuesday and then again at the Town Hall.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Just because you're hopeful and optimistic doesn't mean change is easy right change is always hard in

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
our country and in this case. There are some entrenched special

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
interest that have a stranglehold on Congress because that's the only explanation for why

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.000
after

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
those twenty little darling children and six adults were

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
massacred and ninety percent of the American people supported

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
sensible background checks I mean you just ask yourself this

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
question you want to go buy a gun you go to Wal-Mart and you fill out

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
an application background check three days it comes back. If you clear

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
you get your gun. Why is that so hard why should not every American who wants

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to buy a gun go through

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that that's an infringement on the Second Amendment. That's just saying let's keep us all

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
as safe as we can and so there is not an issue. Having that has

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
frustrated him more than our inability to get Congress to act now I will say a

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
good sign is this isn't cities and states around the country are passing laws so for

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
example we have twenty states that have passed laws that prohibit people who've

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
been convicted of domestic violence from having weapons because the statistics are

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
staggering on women who are killed by boyfriends

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
husbands loved ones who have a history of domestic violence and so that's good

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
news we also

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
have eighteen states that have strengthened their background

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
checks including Connecticut so what Connecticut has done this is really an. Porton datapoint because

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
a lot of times even at the Town Hall we hear people saying well background check isn't going

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to do anything because the people who are buying the guns well they're going to buy them anyway criminals are

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
going to get them anyway.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Connecticut passed their law to strengthen the background checks system gun violence has

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
gone down by forty percent forty percent

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and so the answer to your question haven't is is that the American people are going to have to really

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
create so much pressure on Congress that they have no choice but to act.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
My mother only one

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
sibling snow like we are you right. But I think that let's be real for a second

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
but take a step and get real for a second. Let's talk a little bit more about you. Oh

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
dear you are very mysterious lady. Emma you are just a

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
mysterious to you no not at this moment not in this moment a very what in our research it

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
was very hard to find a lot of information literally yeah I will so let's break it down

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
what you want to know let's get anything right. So you are one of few maybe

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
like two people who are to quote one of our favorite Hamilton songs you

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
are in the room. I won't sing.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I was about to say I want you to leave the

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
great my I love that the I did why I'm going to go

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
back as my daughter I haven't seen any of them got her back I play the soundtrack every day when I

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
get out of business with this man that's but that's a thing you know not that I that

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.000
wasn't part

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of the thing none of us will ever get to experience what is it

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
like to be in the room when one of the power Felix.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Well I'll tell you it's interesting I believe that great presidents.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Emerge from times of enormous challenge. If you look at our nation's history.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Well the president has had enormous challenges and so we've never really had the luxury of sitting

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
back in my hearing our circumstances because there's been so much to

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
do and so I think I will be able to answer that question better. A year and a

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
half from now than I can right now right now I can just tell you that it's like drinking out of

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
a fire hydrant was so much coming at us but yet the president always

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
has this clear vision of where he wants to take the country and so here we are trying to push in the

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
right direction while you've got all of this

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
incoming but is such a privilege I mean there isn't a day when I

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
walk in the doors where I don't pinch myself and say I can't believe I work

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
in the white house growing up my father grew up in D.C..

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Never been to the White House and tell this president was elected had been outside the gate

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
peeking in as a child but never imagined that he would enter the gates let

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
alone that his daughter would work here. You don't just

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
work in a white Well I mean you are the president's senior adviser that isn't

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
a huge deal so like it's awesome feel powerful. Look is it.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I can feel it with

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
advance ability and their enormous responsibility to make sure

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that everything we do we are measuring it by what's in the

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
best interest of people out there on our country who are who have small voices who are

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
counting on us to be their voice.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
That's the pressure I feel it doesn't translate into an exercise of power and translates

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
into people are counting on us they are out there struggling they're trying to make ends

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
meet and they feel sometimes so frustrated when they look at the nonsense

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
going on in Congress and they go why can't our government work better and so our job is to try

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
to do everything within our power to make sure that the government is really working for the

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
people you're very good at not talking about yourself. There's a lot I mean in

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
our research our ask a question I haven't answered. Are people

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.000
afraid of

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
you I hope not I hope and I think I would like to read you a quote

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
that i love of a lot of prefaces by saying I want everyone at in

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
your Me Great think yeah hold on this port is amazing.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
From Vernon Jordan a family friend of yours I know a relative is married to my cousin. Yes.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Where do you go to the New

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
York Times is saying what Valerie developed is the art of telling people to go to

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
hell and making them look forward to the trip.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So that's a question one how that idea that

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
people met was so I think we've learned meant by that is has said look sometimes

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.000
people

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
have they think we can do everything for them anything and everything right and

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
so sometimes we have to disappoint people and I try to do it in the nicest possible

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
way though because they're counting on us and they're hoping for a yes and sometimes yes is a no

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and so I do

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
spend time thinking of thoughtful ways of saying no to people so it's not

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
actually saying go to

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
hell it's the I'm much more

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I'm so sorry but we can't do

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
that for black women people to an to overlook us from

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
one as a that is underestimate us definitely And you know exactly exactly and I think

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
that when people in

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
power are afraid of black women it's because they recognize the

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
power and potential in us

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
to suck up their privilege. You know what I mean and I feel like

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
you have that power. Firstly and everything we

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
read all of the reporting has been

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
she butts heads with Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel and they and very very hard

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
to tell whether the language. I mean they

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
weren't real they same way this

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
is this is the thing I

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
think what you really want is to be

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
respected not always to be like although I do try to

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
be decent to people but you want people to respect

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
you and I think that oftentimes And you know look I started my career as a

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
lawyer I worked at a big law firm there were very many people who look like me at either the two

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
firms that I looked

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
at and I think sometimes women generally black women. Two

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
are underestimated and overlooked and sometimes you'll say he ever been in a

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
meeting this you so I wouldn't know time you say something and everybody kind of ignores it in a man says

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
the same then Englishman and everybody goes oh

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
yeah part of it

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
is you have to find your own voice and you have to command respect

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and so I would rather people respect me than fear

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
may and I've worked hard to earn that

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
respect and the team that we have here at the White House is

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
very collegial and I you know I've read books about prior White Houses and

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
how combative they are and I will tell you some of my closest friends.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I work with here are people we. You've been through the last seven years with people. It's a

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
real test of character and fortitude and integrity but it's also notable that

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
you've stayed such a

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
long time and they

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
haven't you guys can put a face like

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Rob you were you know coming in.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I said look I am at the stage in my life for my daughters grown and married and has their

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
own job and I'm not

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
married and and I love the president and first lady dearly. They're

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
close to my closest friends and I love our country. So for me this is the pinnacle

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
of my life I can't imagine anything I could do that would mean more to me than this.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And so why wouldn't I stay until the absolute last moment I serve at his pleasure but

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I will stay here for as long as he has me said

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
never it never would have occurred to me to leave but then a lot of people have

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
left had other things tugging at them. I'm not sure they're always leaving voluntarily

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
eat food but that's maybe a different story.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
You know the Living on so we wanted to talk a little bit about like you and where you

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
came from we did find out that you were born in Iran to black parents your father was a

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
doctor and he moved to Iran because it was easier for him to get work as a

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
doctor than. We also read

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
that. You being lighter than most of the

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
other people in Iran made you very confused as to like why you would then take the lead when you know

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
the hold on that and your research. What did you learn about

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
race when you were like young like yeah I'm sure that like your father's experience had him impart some

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
very specific

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
things you know so. So let me tell you a little mom my dad and my mom so my dad as I said grew up here

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
in Washington and he went to Howard for college and Howard for medical school and

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
then he went to Chicago he got a residency

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
at St Luke's Hospital in Chicago and it was a very prestigious

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
hospital back there but he was the first African-American to be a physician there.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
And so they would allow him to live. Live in the resident dorms because those were for white

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
only and they told him he had to come in the back door so I said OK I'll talk live as we

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
go back to physical backdoor so he said OK I will live in the you know I live

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
in an apartment somewhere else but I'm a physician I am not walking in the back door I'm going to the

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
front door so the first day of work he walked in the front

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
door and everybody was only gosh what's going on

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
than and he never thought a thing about it was negro I

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
think frankly

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
let's go. So then the next day when he showed up at

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
work all of the staff at the hospital for me or to Lisa the nurses to

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
the administrators who were black were standing at the steps of the front door waiting for

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
him and they all walked in with him on all that it's beautiful it's not a beautiful story.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And so he told me that story as a young age in the context of how you have to stand up for

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
yourself if you want people to respect you back to our earlier conversation. You have to earn it

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
but you also have to demand it. You can expect that somebody is just going to sit around and give you

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
something you have to be willing to take and

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
so when he was in the Army right before he was honorably discharged

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
he was looking for jobs around the country to your

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
point and he was finding that the pay that was being offered. To him

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
was at a rate that was lower than his white counterparts. And so he

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
and my mom were adventuresome spirit and I said look let's

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
just look for a job outside of the United States and we don't have children we can

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
travel and so we looked at of riot different jobs and at that point in time the Shah of

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Iran at that point Iran was a real close ally to the United States and he

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
was determined to improve the medical care in

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Iran and so my father went and helped start. A hospital and she was

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Iran and I was the second baby born in the hospital and so to your question

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
about race it was very hard for my parents to explain to me that I was at

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
that point

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
negro when I was fair skin and a lot of the Iranians and

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
the Iranians look at us as Americans they look at us as

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
African-Americans

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
or we're all Americans to them Are you familiar with their like racial language for

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
their categories or if they have them in the same way they really didn't have

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
a category to do here. And so my

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
parents talked about it and it was important to them that I understand my heritage and

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
who we are as African-Americans and so they

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
thought the cultural difference was more than I could take and we didn't have any

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
other family or friends there who were black and so and I think my mom frankly got homesick

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
and so we decided to move back to Chicago where her mother lived and her sister and a lot of our

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
relatives but before we moved back to Chicago we moved to London for a year.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
In the year I was in London I developed this English

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
accent but by the looks of this if you can imagine.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I go to Chicago I started public school I had been given a really

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
good education when I was in Iran and in London and so I was supposed to be

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
my age in kindergarten and they put me in second grade. So here I am

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
young with an English accent and

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
fair people were so confused about that they didn't know what is an existential

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
meaning Farsi. You know

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
what children don't know. To be

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
different and way then I would say my mother would say a couple ways I had lost that

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
English accent by I was not talking to I was I don't know

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
maybe I was trying to

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
be just like everybody else. So that is fascinating

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
born overseas lived overseas came at a Chicago spent a lot of time in Chicago.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Speaking of Chicago.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Kind of a hot mess right now tough especially surrounded like yes surrounding the mayor

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
and the climate panel investigation it's well mad

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
sad video I have to tell you I had

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
to sit myself down and give myself a real talking to before I looked

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
at it because I just didn't as a mom I wasn't sure I could watch it and I thought to

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
myself I owe it to him to look at it and the first time I looked at it

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
it was I said this before was a hot poker image and. Each time I've seen

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
it it's been the exact same feeling and I just think I'm hours away.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.000
You know how could

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
that. How could that happen to a young young man

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
boy he's not even an adult yet is seventeen years old kid. Well what's notable

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
about the video. In addition to

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
like the horror is the way we've been learning

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
recently that people have covered it up or made attempts to

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
delay releasing it for as long as possible. One of the things that's been reported is

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
that it happened. Coincidentally.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
So near to Mayor Emanuel's election cycle. In

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
general the conversation about it has been who knew what

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
and who didn't want the the video released because it

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
directly was in conflict with what with the police

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
report. Yes let's take a step back from that because as you know after

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Ferguson when Michael Brown was killed the president created this twenty first century task

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
force to take a look at work we could do to improve the relationship between police and the. Unities that they are there

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
to serve and protect and if you look at the recommendations of that task

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
force cities and states that adopt them are going to be able to

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
avoid a lot of these problems so the good news is there you had a body camera because you shouldn't be

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
who said he said you know Michael Brown There was no video and so we don't actually have the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
same kind of visual that you had with

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
MCDONALD The other thing is we want to make sure that police have the training that they need when we have

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
to recognize a vast majority of police they're putting Well all police are putting their life on the line every

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
day they're going out in the streets they're having to make split second decisions

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
where they are scared for their own life and scared for the public's

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
life. I mean I mean there is the training better don't you think we are just early

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I agree. I'm a little weary of the conversations about cameras because one of the things

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
that's significant about this moment is that we now have more footage but

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
nothing seems to be particularly different.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Well he was indicted that may not have happened had we not have a camera because if you think about it with the police

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
said right away is that he was lurching towards them right. So that was out of a

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
video to show that he was actually lurching away. He probably wouldn't have been and dieted

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
and so I think the transparency that comes from the cameras is

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
important I think the training is essential and too many police are out on our streets

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
without what they need to be prepared for those kind of split second

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
decisions that they need to make we need a lot better data

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
collection to look at trends of crimes and what's happening and

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
where another thing that came out of Ferguson for example is a the number and this doesn't

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
get to the. To the violence that leads to death but the number of people who were picked up

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
for tail pipe problem or license plate or the stickers

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
not honor the blinker is not

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
running and these nickel and dime charge penalty charges

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
fees that when you can't afford to pay them turn into a penalty that's doubled and

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
when you can afford

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
that then you have. Get picked up because there's a warrant for your arrest and then

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
you're taken to jail because you can't afford bail and the impact that all of this is

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
happening on communities that are poor is devastating and so we want

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
to just be as transparent as we can we find out situations like

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
that because it puts pressure for

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
change and I think part of the point the broader point I'm trying to make here is is

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
that people now are finding out what's going on in communities all across our country.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
They're demonstrating peacefully. We've seen so many peaceful demonstrations.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
We I don't think we get sufficient credit to the demonstrators who are out there in the cold in

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Chicago follow it all over demonstrating trying to

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
say we want change. Yes certainly I feel like especially the CA

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Chicago conversation the fact that it's even gotten this momentum is Jews all the organizers

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
are wonderful organizers who are out there just trying but make their city

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
better a lot of journalists have through the Freedom of Information Act gotten that you know it's from a

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
minimum and it shows that he knew about it earlier than he said and that

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
it shows there is a difference between what the police said and what actually happened. Do

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
you think Rahm Emanuel should resign.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Well I'm going to say this unit is going to not satisfy you but an hour will feel really detailed in

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
coming so as you know the Loretta Lynch the attorney general has

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
announced that she's taking a look into the situations right now though. And so I really shouldn't

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
comment on Chicago in particular because it's under that investigation of hers.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
So I know that doesn't satisfy you but I think the good news is is that she's looking at the

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
practices that are going on there are trying to figure out what should happen. The good thing

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
about the Justice Department is that they can go

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
when and if they see a trend for example they can require the local

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
city government and the police force to enter into a consent decree with them to make changes

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
and without those changes there can be other consequences.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So that's the advantage of having a justice to. Part of that's

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
able to say we're here to ensure that the liberties and freedoms

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
of average citizens are protected. Are you optimistic. I'm always optimistic.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I am I do believe in change and I and I believe that sometimes it's painful

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
sometimes there are huge personal sacrifices as we've seen but ultimately I

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
think as Martin Luther King said the arc of the moral universe is

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
long but it does bend towards justice to return our secrets book I did I did and

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I had a great conversation with him the summer we were in Aspen together a very

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
notable departure

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
from I think a lot of conversations about race if he doesn't believe the archive of the moral

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
universe I know just as a band sort of chaos. I know I know and I think is. Maybe

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
it's the result of our different life experiences we had that conversation and I I think he

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
he is much more pessimistic than I am I really do

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
think the better angels prevail. Particularly when you have transparency

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
and you have will and I believe that that change takes time

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
and maybe because I'm considerably older than he is I appreciate. I mean out give you a

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
good example if you go back and take a look at the speech that the president gave in

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Selma at the fiftieth anniversary of the march across the Edmund Pettus

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Bridge a lot has happened in our country for good since then I mean

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
my goodness a lot of positive things have

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
happened fifty years is a long time but in the total arc. It's not that long and

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
so if you look at. Rights for African-Americans rights for

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
women rights for They'll G.B.T. community. We've made great strides like a

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
thunderbolt but it does take time. So yeah we had we had that

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
very conversation much more optimistic than he

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
has I want to ask you one question before we move into P.P.P. you. The reason we're here the reason

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
the Obama's are

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
here is essentially because you take mentoring very seriously.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
That's how you all met. That's true and you put President Obama

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
on to. Everyone in the Chicago community that's how Obama.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
You know it all happened because you take very seriously the

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
task of putting young people on putting them in your rolodex to have

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
them make sure they need each other. Like why is that so important to you was there a

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
spreadsheet like what

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
mate like well how can we get into this really how do I get on the list.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Well I'll tell you a story when I finish college I had this plan.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I was going to go right to law school when I finished law school I was going to get a job.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Here the government or a law firm.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I was going to fall madly in love I was going have a baby before I

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
was thirty that biological

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
clock American hometown guy in the on to let me down to do this but now with some of my

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
story is this at age thirty two I had gone to law school I was at a very

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
prestigious law firm I had Mary literally the boy next door who grew whose mother grew up

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
in the same apartment building with my mother. No no my whole

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
life I had a daughter at twenty eight I did all of the things in my

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
plan and I was sitting in a beautiful

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
office in what was then called the Sears Tower in Chicago looking at Lake

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Michigan and I'm crying. I just broke down and cried because I

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
was

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
miserable and I was leaving my daughter every day and going to do something that

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
was unfulfilling to me and a dear friend of mine who I just saw when I was home in Chicago said to

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
me you should consider government service here a Washington first African-American mayor of

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Chicago had just been reelected and he said why don't you go do public service you

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
will care about him in public service

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
he and another woman became my mentors. The woman

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
my client was the first person who told me to ask for my own promotion have either of you

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.000
ever asked for a

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
promotion live long and I know you have a story that's

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
not of when Will and that you know that it will talk about that OK what I would never in my

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.000
wildest

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
dreams. Hard to me to have the courage to ask for a

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
promotion and I did she tell me once you tell me twice and three times before she kept

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
pushing me to go and ask for promotion and she's my client she says you learn to go tell your boss and

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
I remember I walked in there and I was scared to death and I have said Lucille time and need to do this. And

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I went through my list of why I should get a promotion and he said OK.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Now it doesn't always happen that way but if it hadn't been for her pushing

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
me and believing in me and the fact that I also have always

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
worked

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
for either clients or for employers who appreciated

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
that I was a single mom and that I needed to be other be that single mom. That's true and those I know

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
is very rare and that experience taught me first of

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
all how much I owe them because I looked around at my friends who didn't have that

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
situation and the loyalty and I work twice as hard but also said to me I need to do the same

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
for other people and when I was in my law firm I really didn't have that kind of

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
mentorship and I was like the last you know last Oasis out there and so I pledged

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
to myself that I would do better for people based on my last names.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
So that's why I try to take good care of the

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
folks.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
So we're actually gonna make you wish that rapid fire questions segment actually rapid fire

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
with great questions. OK So let's go to number one what's your favorite one of

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
our we will.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Really

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
make it

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
to the

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
thing and

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
that is the you could win a lifetime supply

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
of anything. What would you when I think that's easy ice cream which they with ice cream.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Chocolate vanilla and coffee also really isn't that

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
funny I'll tell you when we all try remember all three of them behind the strawberry not ready to get out.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
That was my dad and I never had

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
it not me but I will put all three of those in one blow and I can live on that. OK I'll let you guess which one of

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
us made this question. Would you read

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
a little it is clearly trying

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
to disavow it for

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
a good question that I was wrong with me on this. Would you rather have a digitally

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
blurred face like criminals on T.V. or have the limited range of

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
motion of a Barbie doll because you know that I have a job. I don't

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
want limited no limited motion I think I'll go for the Blur particularly the older you get the

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
blur the I'm not sure it's really a lot of bright light

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
so much anybody like a good idea to let you know the drill I already know I already have that.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
How do we get a cameo on The Good Wife.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
This is the most I mean I love that show let you go and I'll say this to your fans

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
of the show.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Oh my gosh the people the cast they are nicer in person

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
than he did when I magine they really like do you feel like you're not going to like more than you like put in a word

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I be happy to live than a feeling of these guys have a great podcast

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Well so much fun and the only reason why did it

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
other than I just love the show is that I was able to go on and talk about an issue I care about which is getting women

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
involved in politics and so I help talk Alicia into running it in you

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
know so good in the end.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Great show love being on I can't wait to go back again I think it's maybe OK as

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
far as I know you're the only White House advisor who's been on one of five point

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
one for the breakfast club and

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
not far as I know you must be your

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
favorite rapper. Oh my gosh it's OK if you don't listen to

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
rap but if you do like I do need to like cheesy. OK Really cheesy that they

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
would sound Not really but you know.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Typical Maher was just huge you know I was really impressed with your year he was at the White House

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
he came in he visited the president and you know what the president said to him because he was a little nervous

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Plus is he. He's really a very nice young man and the president said Can you

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
believe they were both sitting in the

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
civil of the

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
process. We are over. I have to ask this last question would

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
you rather have shrimp for fingers. Or bread sticks for toes like

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
long braids. Like all governments. Yes I mean look it's well

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
would it affect the size of my shoe.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Yes that happened to her only issue because like if you just like when in the on in the you know.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Oh it's

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
bright that's a really bad choice there I guess I'll go for the red sticks because more

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
likely to look down at my feeble a good scene but then I want it they would

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
notice my

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
name that is a terrible question

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.000
the

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
I'm glad you guys are angry Daisy.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
your

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:20.000
time

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
so that happened. Raising. Crazy. I'm ready to go

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
in advise everybody now you're just like an advisor and I'm not God

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
then I advise you to not. It's crazy to

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
go from that to like our regular part of the show and now I'm in my

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
right. Evan doing a binary with a I am so

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
glad you know I am going to buy a round for beyond

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
sages ol Knowles

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Carter.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Now I'm buying around specifically

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
for the songs bow down and flaws.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Talk about those two songs firstly and please pass this is going to set the

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
setting too. This was right after four

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
dropped one of her best albums I would say probably my favorite

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
personally and there's just

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
this long stretch of time where we're like Beyonce will never give us another album. Like

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
she just had her baby and. Like OK she's

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
already blessed us with a lot so we should write grateful we can be nationally. But at the time we're like Beyonce

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
was good. OK With good so out of

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
nowhere she drops bowed down slash I've been

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
on I've been on late. I've forgot all about I dunno exactly

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
how good sack

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Lee

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
at that time also important. I'm tired. I don't understand

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
how but there's been so much conversation about it beyond see the feminist. Still

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
stupid and a little the dominantly don't understand of any so she dropped

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
that like the author doesn't talk a lot in interviews to understand the answer you have to

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
read between the lines.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000
And there's a black woman in America. Well versed in Reading Rainbow. So you

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
really have to like listen to her interviews to hear what she's saying but it's basically like at

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
that time there's all these questions about her feminism and like the

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
first line of the song is I know when you were little girls you dreamed of

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
being in my world bowed down over and then the second one is

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
like I took some time to live my life but don't get it I'm just it's little why

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
it's like what

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
the case where a like I'm always playing you all of the nerve to write in any of

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
them directly addressing the haters.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Yeah so that was beautiful and then the whole like chopped and part of

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
the and my dad like he was

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
like y'all have met such a serious you have not met

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Mr Burrus.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Yes

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
the capital gains on bout that life. If you read between the lines

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
between about that

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
life white family race car what about

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
this Mississippi we

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
went from from Baldauf I've been on to another beautiful

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
song called flawless

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
and that if you don't get to the

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
slice around it and the best part of that is when she dropped out on the

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
same feminist conversation happened as people at the I don't know how to

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
listen the N.S.A. said to myself.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
And then I did. So she literally put a speech in

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
the middle of the song right with the definition

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
and she went on the V.M. maintenance that is one of

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
a huge sign that said Hell anything can you make the

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
family write

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
a love that she was like she felt

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
like bold enough to do it what

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
the fuck how dare you she would never say it that way but with that

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
over now it exactly is

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
like that.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
That's where I was like oh my dad the N.S.A. was listening in the Star-Spangled Banner and then he came

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
out and like did I suppose he just like any question. I was like

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
no no we have no questions and yeah but the good thing is that. Even after all

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
that after her like tacitly saying yes I'm with him and is get over it you know was always conversations

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
about Lidle things she was blah blah blah blah blah blah.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
My favorite part was she was like I was just browsing you to about some of

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
this video. Which is the thing that they all the

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
time so it's yeah I just want a girl I see

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
you like I feel like

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
people feel like Beyonce is for everyone and I feel strongly about Bianchi's

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
black audience as a black listening as tag P.S.A. So Legros a lot

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
of it sounds I mean beyond. If you're listening to

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
this please

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
please come through a little bit one interview just for me I can assure

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
you that this will be the best him you've ever had in your life ever.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
We will hit you with a dumb question. We've all come sideways as an avid a you know has

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and it would be great thanks

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Bianca in advance things in it who you want around for choice and prepare

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.000
for a

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
drastic change in tone and feeling I'm listening.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Do you remember that I'm about around for a while it's in you that of said because you haven't time to tell me

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
to get a lot if ever I do now if

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
I got one I was like oh yeah while it's no auto

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Heaven knows everything and don't know everything that Heaven knows this so this

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
might give you a similar feeling that you are just joining us

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
here at another

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
round in spite of hosting a podcast. I am not a fan of Pike

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
and rude disrespectful. As the get out. I still maintain that

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
is

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
just because I don't have the attention span for like I just cannot sit and

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
listen to just people talking for a really long that allowed you know as

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
such and by around for a pod cast because I found that I really like

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
so I get it now I get how like when you have a pike ass where the subject matter is just like right up your alley like

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
you can sit and listen to it like maybe do other things. My favorite thing to do now is to listen to a good

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
high cap and crochet

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Oh I've finally like family too that I

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000
really like all mine and that's so if you want thing that they're going through Crump OK.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I'm not already. I know which I currently like the only genre of high cast that I can

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
like listen to but I started listening to criminal Crow was

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
so good and I'm Phoebe judge this kind

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
of criminal is a great cast. I can't no

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I don't know what does this about me but the episodes

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
that I like most are the ones. About like murder and like

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
crimes and like horrible things. So a different crime every up so yes they

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
might they're like different types and genres of crime and I sometimes not like examining the case of like

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
one specific crime like a phenomenon unlike the time world like justice for like a certain type

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
of leader who has been like that very very interesting. But I listen to all of the murder episodes and I was like.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
And another to France I can't listen to I tried cereal

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
last season I made it halfway through and I was like. I don't remember

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
enough of this stuff like keep up with the builds on information and I do

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
not have the attention span for that but I was googling to cramp I cast and

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
somebody was like check out this park as Coll sorting scale

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
is terrifying and so addictive. So the tagline of the

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
show is like welcome to episode so and so of sword

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
scale a show that proves that the worst monsters are real I mean my God

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I know the cases that they talk about are all like there are some that are too much for me.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Wow To be able to do I know so amazing if you like a friend you will love this job
