00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000

I can use the guys or the US to like do what I devoted I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
don't want to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the you anyways

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because I have a high chair for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you I'm mystified that I hear it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is that all beaks Ligeti I'm so excited for today show saying why

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are you excited. First of all we have what happened one

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
childhood EDITION. That's all story

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
baby then I'm

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
excited and then we're going to talk to the Internet dude. And you know

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that he's a long time friend of the show for some other number so excited.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
He's also a co-founder of maker base a New York City startup always all up in the tech scene but one of the things I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
really love that he did recently was he only retreated with him for years.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
God bless us. I mean that's a great way to instantly improve your social media life instantly

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
my son learned to talk

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
sell before we get on with the bulk of the show we get a lot of tweets asking us to respond

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to Michael Moore's new song White Privilege

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Just kind of farm. I was with the was there laughter and I

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
don't know

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I don't remember seeing it like white privilege to all

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of this time. It's a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
reality and say a people want to know

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
what we think I think it is awesome that white folks are

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
talking to the white folks because yeah we live in the SO should maybe listen to Michael

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Moore but don't think a lot about it because it's not for me. Yeah you gotta

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
teach me shit about white privilege. I get it I know we've been

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
teaching you know we don't live Goldman Sachs too.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm all for white people who get it educating the white people who know that your

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
job shouldn't be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
mine but when it comes to ally ship I always wonder

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
are there often instances of wondering whether or not this

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
person is like extending themselves for the betterment of like the human race or

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
if they're looking for cookies from black people you know I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
mean it's probably both honestly and and the lot of people who work in media obviously a lot

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of black folks and a lot of people have stories about how like.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There is this like huge huge push to get black media outlets the CO the song and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm just like yeah should be sinister Rolling Stone you know I mean like don't push it to us we don't

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
need it it's not for as you know so I don't know if I have any thoughts about it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
though there it. You know

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
just my only thoughts. First of all

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is NO I'M minutes long. That's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
crazy with it and enjoy a listen.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I honestly really don't care about it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I listen to Monk like I wasted my minutes. I just don't care. Oh I run kept asking for

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
my opinion I was like yeah this is a man who's not in my world in

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
my I really enjoy but we have a podcast where we don't have

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to write on to it. Yeah it's not even in our frame of reference as we respond to it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But we like you guys acquired through yeah yeah so if it had been like a vetter sound like a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
good song about why Perlita sounded good to you Do you think your feelings which

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
change. I don't. We know what that could sound like a nine

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
minute good song about

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
white privilege. I think those are all oxymoron. You're right.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I just hate the nobody in the clip me like looted my jeans. You may be

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
taken by White Privilege to.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
No no no the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
second

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I just don't care. Yeah own what the show I

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
still will never get over when he thought he was gay because he could drive cars.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He could draw I mean and then he said that on a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
record out loud.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
That was crazy.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Those are all my Macklemore thoughts.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I chase me what happened was oh my

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
God that's a lovely feel what happens. OK So this is the story of our I bust my head

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
open level with black people say that with me

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I was out of Madison Heights it let live. That's really not and then that that they imagine how much

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
did open the one I merely I mean the evidence in

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the story that your grandma warned you about I did bust my head open. OK So

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
let me set the scene. I'm in third grade.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Oh and they pulled me aside to go into

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the teacher's lounge because my mom had been asking about

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
this gifted kids

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
program at the time honestly I was like

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Mom just just get bored sometimes.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So I was just like I get to go on the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
teachers and the girl and I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
went I was so excited I was so high you know when you're a kid it's like

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
even if you see like your teacher at like the grocery store you do it and you know

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they have a life.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yeah it's a school like the teacher's lounge and my mind was like this mythical place where

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
like things have been I don't know. What was it their own. Oh my

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
God Tracy we got a job we got it so if I have it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I am such a noxious kid I

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
keep rocking back and forth in my chair. I'm distracted understand what

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
you want to do

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and she explicitly said Don't rock back on your chair.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I was rocking back in my chair and I fell I hit the cabinet behind

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
me but you know when they're mass brightly I'm sure. Yes.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So I just bounce back on my own show and she had this look on her face like oh my

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
girl I was like you know calm

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
down and I had I was just like it's just a little bump on my head and I touch my

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
head at the very top of it and then I put my

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.000
hand down and there's blood

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
on my left eye. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm happy

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to know

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that was the way how was your head like stout Oh my God you know the struggle back in the

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
day when I didn't know about products on the

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
field. At that time I was doing a lot of braids box braids. So there

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
wasn't like any padding between like your head in the knot. Yeah. So

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the teachers freaking out I can clearly tell like oh she's done something wrong I don't

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
really respond like she's

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
like because I went to a public school

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
like there's

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
a solution. So

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I might as well you know what we

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
all think we should

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
go. But I

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
realize for awhile after I'm sitting there that there are whole strategy is just wait

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
till the end of the I'm at my parent's going to come

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
sooner because they're working immigrant rights All right so I was like I think I think I'm

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
just going to sit here for hours

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and that's what happened. Oh my God. In that

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
time my childhood crush walked

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
by so you know I'm a nurse's

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
office that's what happened when I read

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
it and you know how every childhood crush has like a crazy name like Chad

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
patted Chatzky or some you know like some random shit I'm not going to say his name because

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I don't want y'all to Google him but it approximates a pad.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Oh whatever I just said a few seconds ago.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I think I'm thinking of a playwright actually.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I'm thinking of a famous playwright. T.V. playwright So Paddy Chayefsky walks

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
by he's like this like super blonde white guy.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
They didn't have many of those and so I went there. Just like so always confused

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I am you know I have we doing here.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I don't know with all my having my

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
head so nonchalant about

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
it I just felt like so special about it he likes it so the

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
nurses often as you are and of course the nurses just like in the corner doing not I

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
was chill and I wasn't you know worried as I should have been. So finally end of the

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
day happens.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
My parents come we go to the hospital my so I asked my sister about the story to just you

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
know corroborate what I remember right. And she's like yeah the car ride with

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
so dramatic that everyone told us you can't let her fall

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
asleep. Oh my God yes. Oh no she's going to heaven in

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that time. Like I said doing everything to keep you

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
entertained. But she's talking like all these stories about you know I have a

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
heaven

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
God we make it to the hospital the doctors

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
like yeah she's pretty bad you need stitches. My sister's

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
a

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
troll a troll and she told

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
me because it was really like straight up down the like me. Middle of my head like

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
a squid and she was like I can see her

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
brain like oh my

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
god so close all contact I had like at that time

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
just finished like yes outclasses and they had me with the regular kids.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So that's also part of why I was like lowkey skeptical of this gifted program like

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
listen I just want my way through Yes well quite right I want to be with the

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
regulator and I was like I was proud of myself for learning English so

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
quickly and then she's like your brains are leaking

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
out

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and then I also called my mom to corroborate the story. You know what she said what

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
if she said I don't

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
remember. Excuse

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
me she doesn't remember the entire incident. Was like Yo I want

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to make sure I got the facts straight about how our family handled this crisis.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Do you remember when I have bust my head open as a

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
child. If you like that she and I honestly that's what I

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
threw alarms and I don't remember this one particular moment in

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Malmo man. Honestly I was like you know immigrant parents have seen

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
them use it to

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Beaver and you and what happened with my mom

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:41.000
doesn't remember me breaking my whole head breaking.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.000

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Jarrett we just do that.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I mean. Well welcome to the show and you'll make yourself a bit more well I

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
feel like no one really ever knows what you do. Yeah I know I

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
do die you just do a million things in PAC. Yeah. Can you give people the

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
short version of all story is right do I just been around

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
a long time and then I have a start up make a basin that's like what I.M.D.B.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is for people make movies and T.V. we are for people make apps and

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
stuff and then really what I read it took me a long time to realize it is

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I love technology and I loved being in the tech industry when I did that and now

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I sort of said well but there's a lot of stuff that's kind of broken and wrong and needs fixing

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and I thought well I guess I better do it because nobody else is doing it

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and so whether that's being you know writing or working nonprofits are all

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
different stuff is like whatever it takes to get tech to see what is wrong and what needs to

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
be fixed that's what I want to be doing.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So that is the what do you do. Why do you do it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Oh my goodness. Well what it's fun I still I still get out over tech like I still

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
like so you gotta check out this app Hugo's website and it's still interesting to me that

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that's shocking to me because I I was when I was like a nerdy kid so we had you know a computer when I

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
was five and I started that's when I started coding and start

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
playing computers and it's still you know interesting me now

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I did that for a long time I mean I you so you're like a seven year old coding.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Yeah but that's a that was a thing like if you were lucky enough in the eighty's

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
to have periods who could like put a computer funny your very kind.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
There was actually a ton of resources or you could go. We had bookstores back then you. Go and get

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
it and it would have been like story type this code into your computer and you

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
would just do it and then exactly that the implications of that which is like the only people that I met

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
in tech were people who were

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
like my parents had hundreds of dollars of disposable income in maybe two to

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
give somebody a

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
computer and then I was like oh my gosh that's us where we are those people that

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
had that level of like privilege

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and we built all this stuff for ourselves and what about everybody else.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
What Japan's

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
did. They both worked for the Pennsylvania Department Transportation for thirty years.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
My dad built highways and my mom worked in the D.M.V.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and actually I mean both their stories are incredible you know like all

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
immigrants but like my dad came in the speech the in the sixty's

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and helped work on the foundation for Disney World as a civil engineer

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and yeah it's crazy and like the the airport Hartsfield Airport and Lana.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
When does he get like free. No he didn't you know he was that he was like a junior engineer that just out

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
of school like he worked on these things and everything

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
get ticketed Yeah resound they said yes well that's why they're like We

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
need some good

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
ass engineers and he's like yeah I'm going to go and then it's like it's one thousand nine hundred fifty four and he goes

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
to Florida and he's like. They won't let me go into this barber shop like I don't

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
know and he didn't know if he's a welcome to

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
America or yeah I know you see master of none. I have they have this. I literally thought

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
the same thing. Do you feel like you have. Like

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the parents at the thought of all about you know. Oh my gosh yeah Henri's

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
learn about your parents and that's pretty crazy My dad was talking about work is never factory. I never

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
knew that you know so by your dad's back story.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I mean I know the big

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
point he was for he was in or around the country. When he

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
came here. I mean you know I got the gist of

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
it was not the gist of every immigrant story that was

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
hard when you care a little more being that he's your dad.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Yeah but again he doesn't talk much. And once on a. Photo of him in the military and he just goes

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
are giant and then like. Walk into another room pretty

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
crazy all the first generation kids with these amazing lives because our parents made

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
these crazy sacrifices and we never thank them like we do nothing

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
to say. Should we do something like a guest or something I mean

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I want to get my dad forgets he doesn't really have any

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
interest. I mean like drinking water staying hydrated. I could get him a gallon of

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.000
water and the

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
gas is persisting in the water of the month

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
love it what if we took him out to a nice dinner and learn more about their lives and he

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
said thank

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
you yeah. Have your parents are opened up and that you know most likely to visit

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I literalistic I'm putting T.V. on you going to watch this movie like we all watched it with them. Yeah.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And they were like We don't want my dad fell asleep and that's

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
accurate and. My mom was a little because like I actually

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
forgot there's like the scene where he's in he's at that thing coffee down on Broadway and he was

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
like he's doing the audition these yelling like

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
well and I don't actually curse in front of my mother and so he's you know if he's like shopping.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
You know obscenities it has long been my mother's sort of like very like oh dear what is

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
this thing you know. And I was like no stick with the mustard and then they

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
get into the heart rending you know kill your chicken part but you haven't seen the episode there's a story of

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
his friend who's saying you know his dad was forced when he's a kid to kill the family chicken

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
his auntie to for

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
dinner and like. Like it was a goat but like I know that story and everybody knows

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
that story real Yeah like that is the real it's like like yeah totally And

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
so it was so resonant and I mean just so powerful is

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
like there's an Indian dude on screen. I waited my whole life.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
My whole life that one of us could be the star and have

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
a sex scene and it's not played for a joke and put your parents on

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
to treat them to respect and they're not played for a joke like just that much. I mean care

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
about their. It's a bit like you could have been like an eighty minute

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
show and been done on one episode I would have been like we maybe we maybe

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
but your mom thing like that was

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
nice comfy can my grandma mean you're like Asian mom is not

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
going to give you that much.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So I mean did that episode of watching the episode with your parents did that spy or

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
any story sharing. This we know because I that's sort of what I do with them every time I'm like

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
tell me about the old

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
country. You didn't tell me about being an immigrant and like I

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
create these narratives where I'm like this very dramatic wall against the backdrop of

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
immigration Yeah the sixty's how they got off a plane and yeah like themselves and

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
they're like we went to work paid our bill which in diapers

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
like there's no you know there

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
isn't well because immigrants just do it like I'm the one I'm the first generation that

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
had enough time to sit there and be like a lot if I told a

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
story you know I don't know I'm not a love

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
story and over thanksgiving break.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah I don't get anything out of nothing really right. And then just like when I got here and we got to work

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
like for example my dad was also an engineer and I was like. I know you went to Europe

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
for college for his master's because at that time it. Yeah interesting programs for

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
that like what was that like living in a completely different continent and you know

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
you know we're

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
dreaming that I was like a little salty about it is that to

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
you I was like you when I was like you went and you knew that you studied and then you

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
were working in Seattle and you know any cool happens like well it's one hundred so it's

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
like what you want and then I'll casually drop something yeah I was it was like you know we

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
saw Jimi Hendrix as like which things that was

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
good about what was I talk about and we

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
did and then all of the next like I was like what kind of life and it's like this larger

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
than life because like especially the time my folks came here. Like I came and

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
because Remonde came in seventy or sixty

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
nine D. couldn't even call home. You know there was no phones like my dad. The village didn't get

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
a phone until one thousand nine hundred three. Satellite phones one for the whole village and then I

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
mean like you couldn't write a letter home to his village. So you didn't talk to anybody he'd ever known

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
his entire life for the first couple of years he lived

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
here and I'm like if you went to the moon you would have better connected. You'd be like All right.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And it's like so yeah that's true like just even understanding that you can't I can't.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So if you're saying that in masses and then you saw the best representation of you in a

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
series what it's like the next best representation is

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
using Oh my god next best. I mean there's like Mindy came and got her show and

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
that's like it's funny obviously it's exaggerate because it's comedy but

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
like you know she's like I checked the Robinson in some ways like she got a

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
show and her name is on the title and she's a producer and like that's big because like

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
you know we had.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
There was a show ahead of the class back in eighty that had a guy named walk along. And it was like

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I mean Robin Givens was on as I say Robin Givens and there's like got any guy you like look in the corner and you

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
know eight seconds Indian Do not break yet right and he wasn't like he wasn't actively getting beaten

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
up at the time and I say Yeah

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
like that's my guy and then for like fifteen years the only primetime Indian

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
is up which is like Hank Azaria and I was like right. If we can get

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
enough representation to where I can complain about

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
it I would be so happy like let me get a terrorist up in here let me

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
just let me get a computer nerd something and write you know and then like because he would put on

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
like and I guess eventually did get Indian doctors like you have a major

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
city hospital with no Indian people in

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
how that family talks break. Not impossible never happened yet the

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
last fifty years like girls beans and in Brooklyn and no black people yeah or Seinfeld or

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
whatever right is this like we it's just it's yeah it's science fiction.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Anyway I just kind of gave up that was the most depressing thing was I was like We're not going to have it.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And I had really I didn't realize how thoroughly I had come to that conclusion. And I remember.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
When the movie for the namesake came out to Bill Harry's book you know and Kal Penn

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
was leading it and it got released. I don't know maybe broke even a song I mean you know wasn't hip but he did OK and I

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
was just like wow this because that book was

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
like I think a lot of folks and other immigrants or writer were like oh I learn things

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
about my kids I learn things about my mother that I didn't know before I read that book by

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
reading her novel like what how

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
they how they wait for us how how and this is a mom thing in general but I

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
think particular to immigrants is like their expectations around who we are going to be

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
and how we're sort of thoughtless in trampling their vision of what they thought their child's going to be because they didn't

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
really going have an American kid.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Oh you know this just because I'm sorry I'm living it he I mean I have a son right

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and so I think about that all the time is how do I

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
not make

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
my honest and good intentioned desires for him

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
to be a burden to him because whoever he is I want to meet and I'm excited about

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
it in that context to be like oh here's this movie. It came out. We've

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
arrived this is all we're going to get and that really was my conviction I didn't realize how thoroughly it was I was like at

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
least that's good. At least it's

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
good. And then. They did.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Outsourced which was this. I think wins and B.C.B. is a comedy and if my memory is

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
a call center comedy and it was it was pure Stepin Fetchit I mean it

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
was bad and kind of a member of the show. I mean they didn't last long but it was definitely couple

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
years ago

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
and I was just like look you all met

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
like we file it like they did a show they put them in the news and in this was a boy yes and it was it

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
was terrible and

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
then everything turned around I mean you had Mindy you had and lots of I

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
mean friend of mine who are going to BOLO was a writer on Kamau Bell show.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And just felt like yeah he started on it was just like any There's in and they're all so good

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I mean that's the other thing is like you got to be twice as good but

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
like Indian are going to pull you in like as easy or so good.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
And I was sort of like you and as these first came out to stand up. It wasn't for me

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
like Indians

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
like you was it is easy to talk to see

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
my Indian

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
impressions and I was just like I guess it's not my

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
thing and then to see with Master and those like oh there was this much in

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
there and a great you know he's older and grew up and it's active always and whatever but I think it's

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.000
also

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
like you just take this leap like I'm only getting this shot like there is not going to

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
be like oh well we'll give you fifteen swings at the bat to do a bunch of field sitcoms like

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I think right Jerry Seinfeld making B. movie.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
You know and like calling whatever got a PA and talk about me.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
It's like an animated movie right. Yeah. I'd even watch it so it's like I didn't watch it I

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
don't know why I'm talking about how molars obsessed with this movie so

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
I see it all the time on the Yass board and Jerry Seinfeld is a

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
be a be transformed into oh right. And I just he was so I don't know if you got it.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Way so he's a B.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
movie and it's a movie about it

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
be. They need

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
and he just called in favors but not that I

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
was I was very I want my nose ideas that I was I got committed now that

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I'm not willing to use them but we want to hear you explain it that man. Anyway the movie is

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
about Jerry that Philip and

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
again somehow something happened and then a human woman falls for her right. I don't

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
mean do you have raining names on them when they're like that feeling when the

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
wife leaves you for a

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
be honest

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
but it is back to your point like true testament to how much was I let me

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
see this like how much leeway people have that got

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
them eating

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
marijuana and imagine if you walk in and it's Jerry Seinfeld he's

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
like fellows. First of all the greatest are in the history of T.V. Second of

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
all I'm a. Movie and I'm going to be a be every That's rather like what he's a funny guy

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
he's got to be kidding because that is a job that's not even a funny joke is just a

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
bad joke and then millions

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
of dollars poorer in just from ever ever just like me writing a check out of my pocket to

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
make your B. movie because you journos and nobody at any point is like you know what

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
this might be bad. This might be the worst. My point is all the B.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
movie money should have gone to Indian people.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Well NOT percent reparations hired a great Yazidi of reparations just

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
as he people the percent.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So we're kind of stuck or like to put in a tough

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
spot when you're like very happy obviously to see yourself represented on

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
T.V. and especially no good way

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
but you also often feel like you can't really criticize or like at least not in mixed company.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
You know I mean yes. For example the fact that a master of none of these on Cyrus character

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
dev only dates this this white woman white women

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
specifically have such a monopoly on the romantic comedy genre. You know it

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
gets frustrating and honestly just like surreal boring.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Yeah see like that same dynamic again they're not the only women and

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I'll probably be OK not only like fun funny quirky. Yeah. We're

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
you know I'm not the ones who get up who are not omitted the right.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Well I'm not saying as these half the cast of like an Indian girl right is literally

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
so many women who has any but always dating.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Yeah yeah well that's interesting because I think he was thoughtful enough to say they're

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
like there's a lead character that is a black woman that is a full person that's all I want to show but not a romantic

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
lead and I think there's still a huge amount to save because one of the big and I think about this

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
a lot.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
One of the big challenges for the South Asian community and us in general is how

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
we play with white privilege right because we are like as long as we keep our heads down we don't talk

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
about it we get into a certain degree we can get into tech and we're not going to.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Like promoted but we can get

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
it that's actually something I want to ask you about because so you work a lot around

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
like diversity and yak. But you've talked about also

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
how Indians are over indexed in tech Yeah totally so. And just kind of closing loop on

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
the master and on pieces like this one of the things that like Indian dues will signal is like you know what we can

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
get white women.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
And why the most part now there have been exceptions but in the you sipping her drink

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
yeah it's literally Kermit was the same

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
but and for the most part like their dads will not like Bristol when

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
the girl brings home for the most part I've had some exceptions but mostly not.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And so like there's some part of that which is like you write this like aspirational

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
You know here's the flaw subversion to me on T.V. and I got a white girl like I think that's part of it and then

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
in tech.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
So I was like at like Index who is in tech

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
companies Google and Facebook and

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Yahoo versus like let's say population California control and California where it

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
was interesting is the proportion of employees that are white proportion of California that are white

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
is actually about even. But of course like proportion of like

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
tech employees at those major companies who are black is like one percent right. Latinos like less

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.000
than two

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
percent like round there and the entire gap in between is made up of Asian

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
mostly Asian men. Right so we over index in a way that that

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
if hiring were equitable pushes out. Really just black

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
and Latino Native folks right like that sort of it. So we're complicit in this

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
like anti-black structure and don't ever talk about it there's no talk because like

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
the C.E.O. of Google is indeed the C.E.O. of Microsoft is indeed C.E.O. of

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Adobe is India like you go down the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
list and like we're able to now we're not promoted into management in an explorer way but

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
like there is a possibility for advancement I mean outside Xerox like

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
there's no black women in these rooms that you're

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
right until like the sixty's and seventy's. When they give me Gratian change and you come

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
here. There hasn't been any sense of like common cause between issues

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
that that Indian a South Asian folks face us and what black folks

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
face and it's like we're here because black people got us the right to be here.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
I mean that's who like to change the civil rights movement so that

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
like indeed could exist in society

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
here South Asian community doesn't talk about it. And there's like it's

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
just they're terrified of it and they're fraid of love and I think part of it is sort of

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
like our position so precarious. We don't even have a T.V. show.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
So if we speak up what happens to

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
us because our history so short. My dad is about as long as you can

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
be in this country he's been here fifty years now and so people were like they

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
could just send us all back. That's happened before you know like in the in the

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
one thousand nine hundred two and they were making these laws like the Chinese lose all this stuff

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
like they just lynched entire towns of Indians or the like now there's no Indians here anymore like and in

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
the northwest and so it was like it was a different thing and I mean obvious doesn't compare the black

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
experience in terms of like the ability to actually move an entire community

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
thing. I kind of want to

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
connect this to a different question we were thinking about in terms of even though you are yourself

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
not Muslim that

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
doesn't matter what you want to do you say Yeah well first

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
of all you travel a lot so I imagine you interact with T.S.A. a lot.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Yeah I actually got global entry which is like pre-check It's like wigs card where you're

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
like yeah yeah whatever the opposite of a black card

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
is they're like.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And you go and you give your fingerprints in their retina scan or whatever

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
and and they're like now we probably won't hassle you as much at the airport.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So did that work. It has worked sometimes. And then

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
like we were we were clear can it because you know can is like hop into terrorism

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
and and like my wife I got split up in going to security and I got detained because I always

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
do. And and she can pass for white and so like

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
she didn't just didn't see me because I just separated and she said where you go as a I went to the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
room you know like like you know how I am like. And then whatever in

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
their other racial profiling Yeah you don't. Oh you recently wrote

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
something for me and I'm the most magnanimous motherfucker you

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
know which is a little bit about this you know traveling all

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
around yeah yeah I mean I actually don't have that back because I know how to signal right like as I can be like I'm going

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
to put on a tie or I would be Yeah exactly and I'm going to look at my i Phone and

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
sighing heavily you know like

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
this guy business guy. You know they're like oh yeah he Johnson give me

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
the numbers but that happens when I get

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
pulled out there was no that hopelessness and I think I mean I think every kid in

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
this town has been stop and frisk knows

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
is the hopelessness of there is nothing I can do there is no I there is

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
no form of respectability I can perform right now that is going to give me a pass because I can literally

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
be like look at my i Phone. There's a picture of me with the president. Yeah. And they'll be like

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
we still got a check and I be like do you think your like Rent a Cop

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
ass knows better than I do down there

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.000
really

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
like Dell but I got to do it and I don't like it's a shitty job and I'm

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
not you know I can't be mad at the person who's actually doing the job but how do you get there to

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
that position. It's like I don't even That's the things I don't even know how to fix in the

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
moment I can't do anything because I'm like I'm not going to miss my

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
flight and legitimately want to know what happened in the room and never

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
know it so they take away your phone. They depend so

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
like a couple times it's just been asking questions with their like they won't they won't put

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
hands on me or whatever and they'll just be

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
like you know they do take away your phone sort of no matter what others be like where you go and

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
who you are you know they're sort of like pretty deep questions and then it's usually like ten fifteen

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
minutes you're free to go in the that's not like we don't want you to miss your flight

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
version. I remember one time I was at L.A.X. I was at a conference. And there was a

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
woman who I'd met at the Commerce and I really know. But like just nodding acquaintance and I had a bunch of the

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
conference right with me as metal

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
detector and she made a joke joke that his saying she was like oh he's not a

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
terrorist he's

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
OK and I was like I was like I had my. I had such side I could see out

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.000
my

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
ear

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
and I was just like do you know you just nothing happen to her she's like to do. Let

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
me go get a

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
latte and I was like here it go. Here we

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
go and and it was you know like they didn't make me strip they were like

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I had a like a like a sweater or like take off your shirt and whatever and you know this is

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
before they did the waist band stuff so they're just like well they aggressively but they feel like if you get

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
a secondary screening now they'll put like two fingers inside your waistband

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
and feel around whatever this is before that so like they were just like kind of aggressively patting me down and I

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
was like Do I have to tip

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
but thank God I'm not there

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
yet

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
and all that and it was I mean it actually it was you know it's humiliating.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
It's just it's just it's humiliating and every time you've ever

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
seen you know young black boy who gets stopped and

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
frisked and you see him walk away and he's like he's clean or you can go and you see a look at his

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
face or he's just burning. And it wasn't that because I don't like I'm a man and

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
I have a certain amount of power and I have some regrets and whatever but

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
like you feel that little bit of that little side and you just I will think about like you

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
say when kids are embarrassed they cry because they're so mad. Yeah and I just I was right there and

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I mean I was in L.A. and I was like. I'm not missing

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
my I'm not missing my flight because that was actually the only thing that

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
kept it together because you can't

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
do anything right no argument you can make you know credential you can

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
provide there is nothing you can say that makes you a person.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Fit a little bit even though it's not really at all are you so. Prize that Donald Trump has made it this far no.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
I mean you America. Listen I feel like the

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
like wave of anti Muslim sentiment didn't come out of nowhere right. Carefully

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
brewing where yellow lab post

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
nine every time I go to a train station or an airport right there like keep an eye out for suspicious packages right.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And I likewise see one with a

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
confederate flag on it on my head I mean I can't be like your

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.000
airline

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
we should get this guy off the plane. I don't happen and I mean I grew up.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
And sort of rural suburban Pennsylvania and it was very red county.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
I have an older sister and she was I think the first person of color in our school district.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Yeah and then yeah yeah it was like school district yesterday and then like all

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
the schools Yeah exactly. Oh make sure you know doesn't mean something different Yeah

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
think there may have been other kids before but I think they probably moved out and so and we were and

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
I mean we were in junior high when the first black family moved

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
in and they got across burned on the yard and this was in the

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
eighty's like this isn't exactly you know. Yeah. So this is

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
like who I am so I'm always like OK this is like after Michael Jackson

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
back came out so

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
must've been eighty seven like that's my and like your time frames are in terms of

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Michael Jackson now well you know they're by Prince albums.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
So you can you can call it sign of the times in love sexy or you can call it bad but it's eighty seven eighty

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
eight around that time and of course like you know we're terrified to like

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
you know I know what side a paper bag I'm on and I know

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
whose daughters I'm going home.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Sorry.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I got on do you think I'm right my son.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Well because you had to know you had to know right you had to know how the press are going to act and

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
that just stayed with me was like this sense of like you know I don't belong here and I remembered

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I remember coming to New York City as a teenager and then eventually when I moved here when I was like twenty one

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.000
and I was like.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Oh well back to do you need me in the hall.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Yeah I think this is

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
almost food. So I would describe you as

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.000
you pretty

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
well. Pretty well I hope I'm trying. Yeah. Like I said I've got a child.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Speaking of this child of yours. When are you going to teach him about

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
race and women in three minutes I'm only because I feel like every man who was not

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
horrible has a duty whence he has a child is allegedly a

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
son to make sure that he got the author of the not horrible rash.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Yes I was using good here LOL I thought yeah yeah. What's your blueprint.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
I want to know what I mean I was born to be trash right like Indian Indian men

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.000
are not

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
raised to like love and respect women like I was the first person in history. My family go on a Date Lab my

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
parents had arranged marriage and everybody back for twenty generations did so like there wasn't some

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
template and my sister. I mean she's the reason that I even moderately redeemed as a

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
human issues like you know anthropologist and a feminist and like just taught me about the world.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
But you know I also in my twenties thought I was the good guy

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
and was probably reprehensible. You

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
know is there anything in particular you look back on where you're like well. Just that I was

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.000
so

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
full of myself like that like Maxwell mansplaining guy.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
And I'm cool Well you know when it's not really blaming I'm

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
covered all men are equal it matter anyway and love really is a matter of

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
just directed at men outlets like kind of feeling. Good. Yeah I mean you clearly think a

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
lot about. Yeah

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
and you're very smart about it like wow how do you teach your son about.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Well I think actually to that to the feminism point of my son. What I realized was what I was going up as I could

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
tell him everything and I know what to say because I had to work at

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
media and I'm like literate and whatever but I didn't do the dishes half the time.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
You know my wife pointed it out and I was like this is true. I'm not doing the dishes have time and I'm not don't have

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
to cooking.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
You know she's. Founder She's an entrepreneur she's an ass kicker like she's got a

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
life like that's all the education he needs about this is what a woman should be like I don't ever worry about that part

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
I think not is like excuse but his explanation I was like oh but like being raised

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
as Indian man they're not like you're going to wash dishes like that does not come up. I'm still working on

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
it like it's still a lot of introspection but I talked to my son about it like what do we do after we you

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
know make dinner we clean up.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
I think that's actually and it's I mean it sounds so like low bar but

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
like he already sees from you know my wife like his mom is like

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
an entrepreneur and an ass kicker and you know creative force

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
and that part is actually the thing that I

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
think about is like how can I be two percent less reprehensible

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
every day and that's a beautiful goal. Thank you for

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
men

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
we could do this forever. Well I think it is time to move on a pew pew

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
pew pew pew pew don't know if you've heard the show before but this is our rapid fire questions

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
that I'm the biggest fan so yes I had. Really I was trying to get you say that you were a big I

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
my God if you even told me a question number a.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
How do you feel about girls. I thought about this so much.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
On principle I object to rodents across the board on principle on principle

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
and squirrels are rats with fuzzy tails. That's just

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
fact that being said they behave in ways that are not as horrible

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
as most other rodents. So they're sort of the most except a bull of

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
the vermin that you would have little run your

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
home. You know what that's a fair answer I will say But why do you have to accept him

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
even you don't have to do so I'm trying to be like an apologist to me I'm trying to I'm

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
trying to detach myself from worldly concerns so that's what I have and I

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
have come back to. What is your favorite type

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
of mango. Oh my God you know where mango and yeah.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
So I proposed to my wife by giving her a

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
mango because scuse me always Yeah because mangoes are serious business. This is true

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
the US didn't

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
allow importing Indian mangoes for like fifty years and then there was a trade like nuclear

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.000
secrets

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
it's all my fault and I'm a you know I'm a man goes and I won't likely it is not worth

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
it and I never said anything credible.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
My mom's favorite mangoes Alphonso So that's definitely up there for me case our mangoes

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
are great that's for sure the pub the thing that matters is to get the variety them because like what we

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
have is mangoes are basically all like the Red Delicious Moshi Apple

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
like and so to have like real mangoes. Yes So that guy was

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
one up one's mango go to

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Queen's go to like Patel those get a case of mangoes spikes save up because it's going to

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
be like thirty dollars for Jason Angus and they come in a season like March or

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
so and I literally like the year that they came out I was

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
like I don't like I would spend my last penny on this like they're so good

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
so it matters like where they're from and how fresh they are and they're not getting that same red

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
yellow mango you see it like the giant supermarket.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
I have not been living you know you know for me the

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
mangosteen mango party.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I do not believe in love I think it's a laugh. I'll have to

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
go Oh my now it's a it's a farce just settle me for me but tell us like

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I want to I like the story of how you proposed with the mango.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Oh we were walking up Second Avenue was a Fourth of July in two thousand and

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
four we had like snuck up on a rooftop to see the fireworks.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
It was like half obstructed

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
view because I don't always have a clue what it was I don't plan to head

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
it and we went to the south and we had some dinner and I

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
was like yeah but I think. Going to have to marry this girl so

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
did you have the mangling

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
your pano like the word. So we walked into a bodega and

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I had just walked in and I was like. I mean about this

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
mango that was literally like

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
it was just like this is well and what happened was that what happened.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I use I used to live real close to by there and the first night I lived in New York City.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
I was

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
like terrified and scared I know anybody who has broken in have a

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
job can sleep and I got up at three in the morning and I had been to that same

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Bodega at three in the morning they were unloading mangoes and they weren't good ones but they were

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
OK and my hometown we hadn't had mangoes my mom was so excited wasn't

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
your Highness' started importing man. Oh my God we were

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
so it was so yeah so foreign and I just thought I can get up any time in this

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
place and have a mango like right off the truck I was just I am

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
where I belong.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And that thought of like this is where I belong and I'm going to be OK and like a mango from that bodega I was

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
it and I was like This is what I want

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
to give my comment

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
right thing so gross.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
I don't know how to try to prove that I never said that out loud before that's kind of embarrassing but

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
on every elbow. Well here. Let's

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
transition very crudely what is the do you think you've ever

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
heard venture

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
capitalist say oh my god there I saw my halls and jobs. Oh gosh there's just

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
so much.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Where do you even start. Or maybe like categories

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
of yeah

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
yeah there's a thing. There's actually a thing where you go into meeting and this is like whether to be Caesar just

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
like the sort of tech leaders in general like these important is where they seem OK. And they're

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
like thoughtful No if you want to hear about these markets we want to do this stuff and we have to be you

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
know user

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
centric and then the. Only woman the offices the admin

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
and she'll come in and you'll see the guy maybe grunt but maybe

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
not even use a word to indicate that he wants like coffee or snack or

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
whatever Lotrel snapping her fingers no little stopping

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
of fingers and you're just like oh shit you had me because the thing for me is like

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
I can be the only like I can be in a room full of all guys. And and they don't

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
know that I'm like the betrayer

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
the patriarch and

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
you sneak in you feel like a man like you know they're gonna catch me and and so

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
they don't know and feel like they're mostly being decent because people are decent most of

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.000
the

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
time. And then it slips for a second and you're like you see by their asking all my God this

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
guy he's doesn't even see this woman is human. So that's the

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
thing it's not even a word it's just that look and like oh you just you just show me the whole game.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I'm Sam God to him and

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
now lets Pepcid Yes I'll happily go out for you have

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
a Would you rather for you oh

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
no no no no no this is the goal

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
and possibly the best one yet. Wow. Would you rather

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
have glow in the dark body hair or only be permitted to

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
use our cream and onion scented

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
deodorant. I haven't had time to get the right

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
well body hair.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Sour cream and onion scented deodorant so. This actually

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
is like more a question of how I feel about my wife that it is actually for me because like me I'm just like I

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
just got a face it like it's just that I don't have to deal with

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
it but what does my wife have to put up with yeah you're right I

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
still love

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
that South Asian people in general are not lacking in body hair.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
So I think I probably would choose the sour cream ending because like I

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
actually think people just get used to it after a while like there's that thing where you. You're with somebody

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
or whatever it is

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
like. There's a lot you just like what you going to

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
do my wife and I met he say Well no I

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
would definitely go for glow in the dark body aren't I think would be fun. Good to know but.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
You know I yeah I think that's a grim choice really. But you know how you go

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
like skating rings like when you were and they had the Black Lightning but I'm a human

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
a Mr Quinn So kudos to you same thing only of the tan hair glow

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
in the dark that's tonight. No no one me party

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
boy. All right so we're going to take a

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
easy live pay summed

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
up support for another

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
round come from square space the squares precisely professionally designed. Regardless of the skill

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
level they take the guesswork out of the complicated stuff which

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
brings us to a little thing we like to call the cold name

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
of drinking yang the Listen Paul I will present

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
fair heaven with a terrifying exhume ill cold and she has to guess what it

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
means and if she loses she drinks this week's piece of

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
terrifying A.C.L. code is basic. B A

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
S I see in all capital letters I'm listening.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Is it a an acronym that stands for beginners all

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
purpose symbolic instruction code be an acronym is stands

for business auxilary

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
think Cash see a cold that converts. A steel mill cold to plain

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000

that we honestly need your help on. Think of this

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
like Shark Tank. Oh shit more like my guppy

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.000
tank that I first like light in the sea that's the name of the segment.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Got me thinking.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
OK We know you know a lot about her like world about products we're all the better off.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000
So we're going to pitch you a few things we're going to ask you a step to the other side of the pitch

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
meeting and guess whether the product or app or whatever is real or came

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
from our

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
minds. All right. The product is called.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
The product is called You see

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
a which stands for United condiment of America.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
You know economists from I guess

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000
is. In Chile one big condiment bottle stores several

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
different

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
condiments wait now. So I got a bottle of Scotch Mayo catch up yesterday

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
all right you know honey mustard. You know they inherit that had like

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
four different. Yes that was caught at one time it.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Is not real not real or did one of those I

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
don't I don't think it is real but I wish it

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
was right. Yeah like I would I would definitely like definitely

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
that that's. Like I would

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
definitely have Q.C. regret ordering

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
that.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Sure yeah great idea good idea. Yes if I had money I would write you

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000
a check for that we can in this day me right now. I mean.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
So this next idea. Is a

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.000
combination fan and Roomba so people this people.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
One thing most annoying about fans is like you know maybe move from side to side or maybe if you get a lot

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
of motion they're doing up and down and in general it's stationary and

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
the situation. You can circulate some air but it's not enough. So

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
a room I will be going around. That's in addition to the fan.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
That is called the fruit

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
but

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
now I'm real because it's not a good idea.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000
It's a bad I don't want you guys aren't downtown and

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
my guess is that you know that well my God it's a good idea but you know it's

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
really good. You know I would rather have a room with

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
a bottle of condiments all comments on top of it that

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
just brought you know so when you let the Bobby Q. Bakley commented on I know

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
you because the hot sauce right now you don't want to ask Leroy to

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
pass it there because you know he's going

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
use it for you like much you can get in like what you consider what devices can go I

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000
don't know anyway. Mr DAY Yes. Is this an actual. Idea that someone had

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
and expected to get money for sure is this just in that year that we think it's

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
cool little eats eats with Izzy he sounds like

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
a terrible rapper. Yeah it is. Yeah

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
that's yeah that's a good like Louisiana rappers. I know younger on a missile.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
So the basic idea is you have little treats for you and

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
your pet so matching snacks.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
So the same treat that your dog eats you can also eat it so the idea is if your dog is

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
eating off your plate.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
You won't die having a good bottle that it won't. And I say AL

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
GREEN OK so when it is about them that takes it one

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
of those big and strips for the one why did you why.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Green has

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
certain Reg Why and

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
how I don't know I had one of my hand I was like you know what it smells like bacon. That's

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
not does it

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
really take the decision making process there was you know I'd gone on that

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000
anyway I

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
think. A low base is I think clearly. I mean.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
I don't know why folks do let their dogs eat off their plates right. Like something.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Yeah but you can't always like eat the same food for like the dog is not supposed to

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
eat what is your verdict and you know the I'm certain

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
that product exists because people will buy any damn thing

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000
for their thinking it exists.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
The next thing is a social media network where

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
people

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
finally can suddenly let you know that your

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
ash. That's

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
necessary

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.000
good. Poke on Facebook Yeah I like it when the new you don't want to put them on blast.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
You just want to be like. Brah. That's Look I want to talk about it right. I want more

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000
social media right now everyone in the hat. That's love

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
because if you if you publicly say they're actually that's a whole different. We only got Twitter for that. Yeah right.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Right that's not. Like that's fashion police.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Yeah that's no you need that's necessary you need to be able to I

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
don't think that exists but I think it

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
should homey Silicon Valley because well that was a great idea I had.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Yeah same day I did I don't think euro billion dollar.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
You know if there are more black people talk about the right to be concerned about a Indians get

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
actually two letters that are that is the truth about you right thank you for entertaining this

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
it will say to you both he was well I'm excited

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
to pitch even more along with.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
And the way

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
message but for life when chill wipers for your glasses. That's not your best

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
work. Are you kidding me. They don't know they're like a funny compliment to

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Gadhafi daughter but also all

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000
real burger babies were for babies. You're just on your phone and you're like I want

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
to baby but only for a little it's a branding challenge it

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
or never thought it was the last one

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:19.000
an app that

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
lets you find the nearest person to you with a dot

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
on you know your block and Middle America to get

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000
safe to meet your folks. Yes it will be called that chic me you me.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000
We need a new version like the sari finder. Yes I

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000
know this is a great idea. Well. Well talk was alright thanks for the support.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
inspiring. Thank you so much for topping it up with awesome young working

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
people find a work in the old ash dot com is where most of my stuff on the

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
list and if you make apps and such a comic relief that was

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
cool. And you often do the Twitter. I am going to. You know that I'm always surprised people

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Tracy when it's time for

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
ran well my gosh I was

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
right about my rounds today who by around four

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
am buying around for each and every person who takes a medicine for some

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000
sort of oh my

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
God God's loving me. So today

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000
is my very first day on a new medicine for my eighty. If Family Guy band of that I

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
finally went to the doctor for I'm very proud of myself but you know what I discovered is that I

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
feel like even as comfortable as I am with like being in open and talking about life taking a pill for

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
my nightie there's still some it like the shameful stigma the way. Real highs around you

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000
know this is not a medicine that you just take when you have like

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000
a big paper to write or something so that you can focus in the moment and take it like every day.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Yeah in-cell Like I said and I was like man I'm taking two different like medicines to get my

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
brains together.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
And I felt like bad thing and I was like you know I don't want this to be like I

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
just got settled with like taken

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000
one pill and yeah I've now got to do it all over again with two. Listen I joined the club a few weeks

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
ago I was working alone. It

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
will be something the company the first visit that you take you back to get a new medicine it's going to

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
be followed up with several more B.S. like the medicine management thing like getting the

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
dosage right yet to come up here how bad a song was going on is a lot and we

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
jump through.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Yeah we jump through so many hoops just to like get that together and feel

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
better you know the mind is about around because I mean that's my

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
God it's a lot it's so much in the best part though is like once you finally DO found

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000
like the right combination or whatever the right dosage. You know life becomes so much easier because you

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
are hurdles you have to. Up then the the line of thinking becomes how did I do this.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Oh my God myself. Well.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Actually you know it shout to people who may be dealing with a suffering from

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
anxiety depression or whatever who could probably benefit from medicines. But who

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.000
aren't on them right now

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
like this it is hard with medicine I know. So without

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
it man. Listen in this isn't me like Tell me about running a minute and I'm saying

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
is I appreciate I get it understand the struggle. Hang in

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
there have a round on

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
me I never feel more like just a just a dumb

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
mammal when I'm trying out new meds like if you just put different chemicals in

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
me although I get entirely different personality and that's kind of scary when you think I don't know.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
When everything on the line to be happy all that was said in

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
the press. Well

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
be around it's minor.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
So you went in for what do you been around for I would like to buy around four fake eyelashes.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yes they had south on so

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I always just never thought about them because that seem like so much

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
work I can't even paint my nails into dexterity for

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
working eyelashes. You can have like glued me or the little

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
hole I make I just see. Yeah yeah exactly. I always assumed it was not for me

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and then one day a humble brag a little bit old fashioned to

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.000
inflict

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
black and she put fake eyelashes on me and I felt like a different person I felt like my philosophy is

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
good mom is if you have a name. Your thoughts are fair. Oh what is my interest.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Probably like

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
that

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
nothing crazy. So much more fabulous version of right. Anyways.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Real talk. I think I understand from izing that because of the lashes.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
There's something so much like

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I love making. So much. I was never at this point like even a few years ago.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I never thought I would be the kind of person who was make it just so much fun is a lot if

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I think a lot about

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
what Audie Cornish said in our interview with her about. Like the armor you wear.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah when you're facing the world yeah that is what my bright red

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
lipstick is that is what my fake eyelashes are there's something about being like super

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
super fam. Yeah where you're like actually batting your

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
eyelashes and it's always so dramatic it's so dramatic

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
but you know I love me some drama. I know Greg I

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
mean here's my thing they're hard to play OK OK

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
so all I am with you I am with you a thousand percent. This is why I don't even do my

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
own while the makeup artist

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
is doing it I like this is incredible but this is obviously not a look I can recreate in my

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.000
casual

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
life. I tried it again and I had a pair of fake

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
eyelashes had a pair of the back.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I had fake eyelashes that I just kept saving for a special occasion.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
One of my New Year's resolutions was to stop saving things for a special occasion and that is

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
because resolutions all rule of being alive is a special occasion. Oh yeah I was like fuck it

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I'll put him on just to go on we go and it was

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
a dexterity struggle but if you're patient and

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
honestly I really like how patient makeup makes me like how much time and

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
preparation and like just you can honestly like meditate while you're putting on your

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
makeup this year so I can carefully not. Well

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
but carefully put on these lashes and I look great the glue is a serious situation.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I don't get crazy. Listen I

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
could tell you how many times I have superluminal own thing.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Not that I'm but I keep am trying to work with my eyes shut my partner. Because I was going to

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
happen and I know it

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
is round for Super from super luxury is like Fern over you

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
like this believe in well you know

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
it was just the big I didn't feel like you know I didn't

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
think that's exactly how

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I was like OK I don't have the same thing for special occasions. But you know

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
is the man

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
that gave us the phrase. I'm not as hell and I'm not going to take it.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm not a dude from the movie Network. Don't forget to take your

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
meds drinks and

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
wider flaw was his good

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
luck it is very important indulge your

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Campbell game. Yes like the floods of war yesterday and all you know it as you

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
do girl take take us thirty dollars go to like

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
a T.J. Maxx or Marshall from the home get section and get one of those

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
like abnormally

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
South blanket to listen

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
is important get the king sad one in all my God speak in

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
his cell softy. You have to never lie so tightly that you

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
can really feel just cut off from the rest of the world and online God being in the this is the best advice I've ever

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
heard yet yourself don't want to blow my winter get you down fight the good fight.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
back.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Another thing my sister trolled me into doing. We had to share a room we have beds bunk beds.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Somehow she told me into owning the territory that included the door when

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
we split our

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
room so I had to jump from my

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
section and for some reason I just

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
went along with it. Yes this is

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and that I'm in you know in retrospect I was I'm honestly pretty

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
impressed. That is your to convince herself that she has

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
a certain height to exit her bedroom that you share with her

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.000
just because

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
you want to monopoly on the door. You know vote for her carried out at the

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
sister's.
