He will land funny and nice and he between the House and the people.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The you. People love

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
been livin on the moon heaven. What is it. It is a musical

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
about Alexander Hamilton with rapping which

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
sounds horrible but it is so beautifully executed. First you're

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
just like what's happening and then you're like why am I crying. It's moving it's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
moving emotional rollercoaster in the in the best

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
way

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
before we talk to women well I'm get our whole life changed.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I've been thinking about something and I wanted to get credit me with

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that so I began it was about how kind of crazy this election

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.000
cycle has

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
been remember when Ben Carson said he nice.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Someone you know you're going to face and. That was

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
weird but I guess I will never forget he said Popeye's organization.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You know a lot of people have never been in a clockwise. Anyways I was also thinking

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
about Jeb Bush. Do you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
remember when he was he did randomly had turtles in his

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
pocket dial it. They're not

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
real turtles. Oh OK That was a little cool idea is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.000
he was either

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
campaign flop at a restaurant you know like I'm humble with the people blah blah blah. And he gives

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this kid a turtle and he says slow and steady wins that right. He was

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
while real implacable a total. So first of all jab that is not how you run a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
campaign said he did not win the race and he is I like him pain

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
even a reporter had the same question you didn't do you just walk around with

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
startled. I mean to live with his hands that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
he reaches into his pocket and he's like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
yup. I have a little baby Jesus

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and the retard all

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
over the kernel in your pocket

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
dimensions. You have let a pocketful a turtle. That is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
really

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in here. That's going to fill the news coverage remains and I guess

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
return punch back what's going on in Jeb Bush's pockets.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Anyways job is a very interesting figure and I feel like in honor of one

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
man well what I've been thinking a lot about people who deserve a musical

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
getting is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
there and when men will ask me as I do you. I'm

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
very fascinated by white men who have something handed to them who wonder really fuck it up. Let's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
do your job

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
musical. Ladies and gentlemen we are pleased

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to present to you boys family even the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
CPPCC dance in uncomfortable musical about

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
an awkward man in his quest for the American presidency.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen if you're not familiar all of his campaign materials.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Very actively sought to a race of. His very familiar name. So

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
he put an exclamation point yet after every job and my favorite

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
thing that Stephen Colbert has done all campaign season is he pronounces the exclamation

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
point every time he says

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
man.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
My least excited man why would you put up with some political if you're not excited and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
you who else needs an exclamation point more you know what you write Arianna.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This is Jeff and I'm comfortable musical.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Starring Steven Kull there as the embattled John Ellis jab Bush

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
jab is another way to wrap for a about a man and a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
very questionable decisions. You know his real name is not Jeb he's choosing to go

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to college on

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
no app is it Jim is his political nemesis Donald

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Trump played by Tommy Tiny Lister known also as the ball from the movie

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Freddy.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And occasionally in Jebel corner is Harry Connick Jr in the role that he was born to play

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the flamboyant Texan and former President George W. Bush who lab's up the stage

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
with the flat he found what did I do at the rim and is about all the things he fucked up while and.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What did I do.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But sure start to play though is the legendary Leon. Who gives a rousing performance as the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
exclamation point this will. Thin address and say Today I am Jim failing campaign.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I thought Will he do it no no you won't

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
see. The track list includes songs such

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
as jab. Please clap. Oh yeah

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that moment he went to take a pause.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
That was honestly so it had a lunch and a rally at his

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
own rally. Do you have a pen you would like I want you know would like

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
politicians see that reflection where they rise up the points and he was. Since there is.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
People may didn't have that right. First of all. And then that's just like I made a point

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
guys in the middle so defeated

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
like his shoulders just sunk he was like Please

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
help you know he did look like you're a little bit. Thanks for

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
noticing other songs

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
include my personal favorite. OK as the moms and most powerful of brothers.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Can we talk briefly about how his mom is always talking bad

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
about you know please I'm all about how I didn't like the road pain

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
like that.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So he released this ad and he goes the best news of the day was that my mom finally said I was

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
her favorite to which she says.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Oh no I did it she said laughing. I mean of all the children.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Yeah. Bush said and I know.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
There's a stirring track. History has its eyes on your entire family because they know

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
me about

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
shit and then the phantom sound of the please

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
clap reprisal moms play it everywhere.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The best part was when it was finally over grave the New York Times and if they

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
play much like the jobs campaign was completely unnecessary. So is Playboy magazine.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Bless your heart said Barbara Bush and do you

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
ever feel a Bush impression. I mean I don't

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
but it was

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
good I don't know if I tried I tried. You know

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
now

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
you think you think Lynn will produce this with

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
it doesn't work to do I am going to be positive.

He's waiting for us in the video room. But the two quarters. Let's ask him hours so I mean

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I'm not against any avatar. I'm done. You

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:26.000
know I don't know if people want that for my feet but I'm a little rock.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
wanted

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
a scout on the show because he is like the kind of

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
weird uncreative that makes brilliant brilliant things he

has been nominated for and one Tony Awards for his place in the heights and bring in on it respectively.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He'll probably win seven thousand between seven thousand and ten thousand Tonys for his

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I believe a lot of men like that no man has been on offer frankly Hamilton which

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is the rapid Erap play

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000
about the top

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000

Thank you for putting a reference to our show and your show Hamilton another round. Let's have another round.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
You're welcome. So your show is kind of a. Incredibly rare thing in pop culture

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and it's kind of changed the pop culture landscape I never thought in my life that I would feel like people really

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
really excited about a hip hop history. It's called

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
me what were some of the things pop culture wise for you growing up that were important to you.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Well the last time something like this happened with musical theater which was rent. I mean I got to see

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
rent from the last row of the New Zealanders theater for my seventeenth

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
birthday and I love the musicals but it was like you

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
know when you're teenager everything's compartmentalized like I spoke Spanish at home I spoke English at

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
school I spoke musical to my musical friends I spoke to my hip hop friends and

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
like never let anything meet in the middle really and rent was

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
huge it was like a totally diverse cast it took place in the

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
present which doesn't sound like a big deal but think about how many

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
musicals take place in the I mean even Chorus Line was like a period piece by the time I saw

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
it when I was a teenager and so I was just like. Oh you're allowed to write musicals about

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
now and that I think is what gave me permission tacitly be like oh you're allowed to

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
write musicals about whatever you want and they can be about your life experience and they can be about the things you know they're not

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
all like cats and phantoms

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and and so that was a big one for

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
me but then you know I it's the same stuff as everybody else you know

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I danced and made everyone watch me memorize the Thriller dance in

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the last day of high

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
school actually I was on the step.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Seem all over my god that's how I didn't I can tell you guys had a

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
step to my letter.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
All six of us because God only made it into

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
a lab to make up my

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
last day of high school I did not spend in class. It was an arts day which was when they would like the assembly

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and you would all have to go see like some students performing and we did the Janet Jackson. If

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
dance video. Oh my God it was Omar my gas remember Omar from that

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
they guess who I was first grade Oh

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
my God I know. OK let me. This is not related to. Absolutely. They were one of my dreams.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Do you remember the fight that airline outen had in that hotel room

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
in Vegas. I know all about

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
it. Not that I might want to remind I

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
didn't care to tell you I'm the only one who hasn't seen that season because I know a lot and I didn't want to watch it.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I knew Gabe was her boyfriend that she broke up with on the show like they

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
were high school sweethearts all time. Well no but I'm not going to I can't watch.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Oh my God that's amazing. OK we've had a big

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
lead knowing way. When did you first like at the very very first time you saw

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
yourself and felt represented in

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
pop culture what was it.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
That's a fantastic question. It's it's. So scarce as a kid that like

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that the examples are insane thinking

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
of us a little Chihuahua in Oliver and Company. I cheated

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
on a visa. Tortured Jamie to the ball. I know that

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
guy sounds like my uncle I was that she was that's us.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Oh that's how bad it is real money comes out you

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
know I mean like momma was like our movie that was that was the big shit for us. I'm

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
trying to think what else but like literally the first thing came to mind was a fucking cartoon showing

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Wow that is it's beautiful and I felt very sad you know the way.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
That was a big deal for me also was John Leguizamo when he started doing his one man show. I remember

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
taping Mambo Mouth and tapings book around my memorized. But my mom my V.H.S. cassette

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and like this is the guy was just like you play all the parts and he like.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Wrote. He just wrote his own show where he got to play all these MARTIN That was a huge deal.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Yeah this is so and let's keep on this path now memory Lang. OK.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
When did you realize that whiteness was a thing or when did

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
you realize that you were not wait.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Oh so early I mean again. So I went to Hunter which is this like magnet

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
school it's a public school but it's a school for nerds like you have to pass a test to get in and I got in

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
in kindergarten. So I went from

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
a nursery school in the hundred fifty

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
S. to literally my name changing like I went from being Manuel to

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Lynton because I couldn't take people mangling my losses call me Lin Yeah your so

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I would like the switching of like Spanish to English and English to Spanish

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and slang changing happened when I was really young and in

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
retrospect I'm grateful for it because I can kind of hang wherever.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But yeah that's probably where I mean it was literally just teachers and students who

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
couldn't pronounce my name. Yeah we wanted to call us which sourly. Yeah absolutely

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Well yeah I have remember being the translator for any Latinos that were

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
came into our life on the Upper East Side whether

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
they like the nanny who speak Spanish to me but speaks English to the kids she takes care

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
of what we're playing at her house too. I remember once being the translator for

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the coco a lot of the guys because a kid wanted to ask of a stain was

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
going to come out ask him if this will come out and I'm like right on

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
the fact and goes to say how does he manage the language translator here on the Upper

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
East or the far. Oh if only you had charge for your services back then listen you know I would never have

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
a regular

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
life so your doubted Luis A Miranda Yunior you know

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
he worked for Mayor Ed Koch. He's the founder and former president of

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
the Hispanic Federation and you worked in his office even wrote some jingles

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
for political ads. I've

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
learned I did I would write. I don't write jingles it wasn't like I was writing I like Ike or like things

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
people say and I was writing like the background music for commercials. Mostly I doubt

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
my dad would say hey I have Sharpton spot. I need like

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
sixty seconds of jazz jazz under the political message is going to be on

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the B.L.S. official acting you gotta have you got dad who's let naturally music to

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the station and

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and remember writing like hopeful Latin music for like Eliot Spitzer's Spanish

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
language spots and that was like how I paid the rent he was like OK you want to

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
career in music OK Well here's you know write write these jingles.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So how do you feel like that background especially like watching politics happen through

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
your dad like informs your work

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
now you know it's funny it's never really considered it until I started writing this

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
show one I'm allergic like I'm just you're never going to see me run

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
for anything. I was like that was you know I think if I

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
was a butcher's son I would want to be a butcher you know it's just the thing you know when your parents do it like.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It expresses itself. Mostly in that song room where it happens where

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
it's it's all sort of ambition and you know so much

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
happens. In deals between people like the things we vote

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
for are very rarely the things that matter. We can vote to get the people in the

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
room but it's the conversation in the room and we're not a part of that and don't kid yourself

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and think that you can put pressure on that conversation and suggest that you're not in that room. I

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
didn't even realize I knew that until I knew it was funny. Governor Cuomo came to see the

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
show and he said I can tell you learned politics like a kitchen table because

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
the stuff is

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
very it's not political in a capital P. sense it's just sort

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
of like let's how it works. I've never seen these two guys once at a function My dad was at.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Congratulating themselves for like just totally fucking over a different guy being like oh

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
my God teach you hear what he said as he does know we're going to fold up to

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
the idea that smaller takes. So it's just like

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
the audience and I like the you know

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
we in our in our hearts it's West Wing in reality it's somewhere between

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
West Wing and Veep.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Yes So we learned a little bit about baby lane. And now baby Lane has a baby lamb of his

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
own he touched. He is adorable from what we can see we've never seen

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
a thing you know he always I met he just surrounded by music all the

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
time he loves the Kendrick keep bouncing

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
back and I where I was just playing him when he was in the jump or he's too big for

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
the jump or he's actually walking around now but when he was in the jumper. I would just play all the loudest Busta Rhymes

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
songs because the fast life Dr Drew so there was some like to see a

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
baby dancing to give me as a real hit the most people you know what I'm reading you're

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
like one of my favorite things when you tweet things your son thinks you

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
look like oh boy my favorite personally is cat

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
William I light skin friend

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I don't know where the guys I'm at right in my life.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Started it was going to start. When Chris Jackson posted like one of the first pictures

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
of Hamilton one of the friends of like what was in your

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
place in the past. I just thought it was so funny and so dead on the remember I

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
remember when I really let the hair flow something particularly with him I was just

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
about that oh my God this is my embrace. That's right

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
published and then Alexander Hamilton go it's our P. and.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
There was this really moment where he sees you on T.V. goes Dad and then he looks at Ray

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Romano and I looked at the Lego man he goes on the mommy.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Here you know you want everything you know. So this question is a little

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
it's a little heavier you. But what will you teach them about women and white people.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Hush. You know that's a great question. There's two conversations I remember

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
from being a kid that jumped out at me which I guess help me answer this question.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I remember coming home and asking my family if we were white.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Because it's often presented as binary and you know Reagan's are like

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
literally the gumbo. And they were Yeah but we're. Everything.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And so they're like no I'm like but I'm the same color as like half the kids in my school and they're like No you're

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
not you're not. And here's why and you know I think from then on it

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
was like Puerto Rican flags out white and you got to learn so

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
that will be that conversation when that happens.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I mean I'm excited for my son because he's got incredible female role

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
models starting with my wife

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
who you know was bored of being a scientist and became a lawyer

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
like that but I mean you know I'm glad

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
she is going to you know should run for president and you know my you know my mother

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and just all the women are life I grew up in a house with women with my sister and my

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
mother and the woman who raised us like just strong women like throughout so that

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
was not worried about that I think he's going to be all

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
right that's dope. So this sort of touches on another question that we had a coworker and friend of

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
ours tweeted what I think is the best tweet on earth ever. OK no

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
say to you in your tweet you're really really good she tweeted behind every

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.000
walk

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
man is an exhaustive feminist you need to

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
think good race.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
We would refer to you as well.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Oh thank you yeah you want a sleepy but well completely the well nobody

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
can Who do we think we are

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
welcome this. Oh gosh I just thank my mother for it.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I mean my mom's psychologist. My mom was

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
a single mom for a while my my my sister's Actually my half sister when my parents met

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
my sister's about six. And my mom was diagnosed

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
with thyroid cancer when she was like nineteen years old went through that she was she

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
basically that happened then and she said oh I might die had an affair with

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
one of her teachers.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yes mama Livia lie had a very being was like well I'm probably gonna die so I'm having this baby and they

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
always say. Such a crazy thing but she says it was the year Roe v

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Wade happened. She goes. So she says she says to my sister honey

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I show

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
you I shows you and I did a little all right Paula.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Mom I'm talking seventy three. Yeah.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And like literally working at Howard Johnson's working like six waitress jobs put herself through

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
school like finish her doctorate. She met my

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
dad when she was getting her degree just did all of the jobs so that we

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
could go to school and not worry about it. My parents are like one of the few sets of parents that

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
are still together and I think it's because they both work they work in really different fields and they

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
come home at the end the day and are genuinely happy to see how they're

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
like I don't think I could have dated an actor or a writer like it's great to come home

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
and we don't talk about like the stuff that you're dealing with all day.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Yeah I want to backtrack a little bit Was it weird to find out or hear that your mom had an affair.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Yeah I didn't figure out until way later that you take it out versus the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
untold No no I was told but I mean just like the sing of it I mean but

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
it's mostly I remember when I heard about just thinking about how scared she must have been

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
like to

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
be young and dealing with what could've been a death

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
sentence and also a child on the way and she was just so strong

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
throughout it.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I wasn't scandalised I just had the surge of empathy of like you know my life's been

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
actually really home compared to even what my sister went through so yeah

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
it's you know the benefit Phishy area of all of

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
that struggle. I don't know how I'd feel. For that be like oh

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
my gosh you have

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
sex. And then like by myself I'd be

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
like oh no I don't understand why parents make no secret of it they're there all over each other still

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
really

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
not that I remember once my kids was going to kill me for

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
telling the story. Yes. I was watching there was a phase where V H

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
one was like rewriting American Bandstand and I was. For it was I think

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive came on board of the song and I was changed then all my dad came in from the

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
other room he goes don't

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
you ever change the channel of that song you were

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
conceived in one thousand nine hundred ninety nine I was like

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
oh man I'm gonna try to picture you having sex to Gloria

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Gaynor why the very interesting just announcement out in the mobile maroon

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Yeah I was afraid I was the mean

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.000
member

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
women's room where yeah OK can you jam session a little bit to Hamilton in the

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
heights the bulk of your work. Yes yes yes

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
and then you know. OK So Hamilton is

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
very rare in that the

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
bulk of the principal cast is all people of color except

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
for Jonathan Groff Yes George. Yeah within the principles Yeah yeah. Which is amazing.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
That's so beautiful to see and when I did you think oh at all about

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
like gender bending in addition to like Ray spending the

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
character not really well you know it's funny the diversity of the characters really came

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
out of the thing by which I mean to say I wasn't picturing the literal founding fathers even when I

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
read the book for the first time. Wow I was picturing Hercules Mulligan that is the Busta Rhymes Yes

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
sounding name. I was Hercules all you know yeah

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
right you know and then when I was reading about Washington All right well what does he

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
sound like and I was already

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
like casting R. and B. artist of artists in my head what I'm excited about is I'm not going to

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
put restrictions on gender for when we do the high school productions in the regional production so there are going to

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
be mainly because I care so much about the school play. Like

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I'm here because I like found who I was in the school

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
play and girls try out to guys like a nine to one ratio Yeah

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
like it's nationally in girls that large convoys and one boy you beg not to

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
do basketball they said he was the last night I come on

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Troy and there's a

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
girl I want the people who want to do the show to do the show and so I'm looking forward

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.000
to

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
that I'm curious a little bit about how the hip hop and Broadway

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
community work in the heights producer Geoffrey Sellers

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
said I did Heights which ran for three years and if it didn't have that label of hip hop painted on it

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
all the time it would still be running because it was a beautiful emotionally satisfying show. Do you

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
worry about that like the label of hip hop.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And then travel month I don't worry about it for my own purposes. I have no problem with people calling it

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
hip hop musical I know how much hip hop contains like a new pop right has enough

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
room for melody and has enough room for emotional richness

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
and there's so many different kinds like hip hop culture contains so many

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
multitude that I know that I means a lot of great things but there are also is

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
a whole section of the world for

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
whom hip hop frozen their heads around one thousand nine hundred three No I think it's a drum machine and like talking.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Yeah like literally like no I like a melody so I don't like hip hop. Yeah and that's you know that's

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
a good chunk of the Broadway demographic converse

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Lee That's also true I think of hip hop heads who do not fuck with

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
either music at all because there's nothing in there.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
There's not a drop to beat. There's nothing that speaks to what they like but what I like

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
about both of them is that the they tell stories and they use music in a way to

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
tell stories in a way so I'm always kind of threading that

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
needle in my work of being like it's OK Leave your baggage at the door it's OK Leave your baggage at the

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
door handle both groups and get in getting them in the room together.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
There's a lot of amazing storytelling in hip hop and there's a lot of amazing music in theater music and you

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
know we know that Broadway show can be rented a Broadway show. Can be Bring the Noise Bring the funk in the

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Broadway show can be like it can be a lot of different things and we can be a lot of different things. Yeah I

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
mean labels can be a problem for ticket

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
going public. Yeah. Have you heard of any accounts of someone being like

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
you know before this I didn't listen to hip hop and now I'm like listen and Buster

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
I'm frank I can talk to like high really all the time.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And people ask me for primers of like all right. I love Hamilton so what Hip-Hop should I listen to

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
this makes

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
me really hard when you don't like your emails like the emails you get can I have my life.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Yeah yeah.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
So what do what do you recommend to those I recommend a diet of lots of different

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
things for the fun thing was it really first started happening with Broadway

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
like composers like composers like tight so like I said

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
and Sondheim like an ISA Brock's

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
track on what is our economy. So we tell this story. I think I was

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
like talk to me you would like this song. It's called No regrets by a Sobrante and it's a great

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
hip hop tune was like oh it's just like. I feel like

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
the same with the standing on the bank in the pool with the reporters.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I've never had a dream in the U.S. what you wanted to do I knew what I

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
wanted was been a dream that I wanted to be

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
paid for so that's that's part of the gig as you said in the come a bit

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
of a translator and also the one you get where it's like I hate rap but I love this. And

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I always tell them that's not a compliment. Which is an

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
awkward stage your interaction I go knock on a compliment to me. I go. You're missing out.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
That's just like those dude's I don't know if it's just like a me thing but when like a dude is it one you black

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
man you know family has in my mind. They're like you know what you're not like other black women.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Thank the

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
flying past so

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
offensive. So I say that. So what is it about those particular rappers that like make

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
them good starter meals for people who are just getting into a.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I think it's because the storytelling is just on deniable like whether you're

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
even familiar with the terms nonces using which like most folks are like oh this

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
is already you know you're like I don't know what a burner is I don't know what you're saying when

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
they catch a body my literally exactly the trust

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.000
fall I

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
know it's

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
just because I did those in Peter

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Tatchell spot already ready.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
But yeah I mean the storytelling of like the second verse of Rosa Parks or the story telling the artist

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
or telling part one that's on the ground.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Oh my gosh I mean I laugh. It does that yeah yeah it's like

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
that you know outcast is I think they're like the

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
last ones who have not seen him.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Most of the ones on my left like been crossed off and I am ready. When they

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
come become baptized

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
a love letter to to them and I find myself in a lifelong manner the outcast. It's

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
a love letter to hip hop the whole show. So many hip hop references in my lyrics to the show

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
that like I'll find myself doing the cadence if I know erupt like when Eminem was there

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I was like hitting those

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
syllables alternative the that's basically what you know that

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
is the expectation every action and

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:30.000
the something can pass tomorrow.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So yeah so yeah I always look towards the ones where like the storytelling

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
is undeniable like seen a man die

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Scarface creatures fall there with his hands up.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Yeah he's great and

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
he can we break for a refill. Oh yeah you

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
see the

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
same shot.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
The way ma.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Support for another round comes from August a new kind of consulting company that's starting a revolution in the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
way organizations work from helping leaders embrace change to building work cultures where people act

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
like people and not like business

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
robots to poop. Which

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
brings us to a little thing we like to call the corporate jargon drinking game.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
The rules are simple. I will present Fairhaven with a particularly

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.000
stupid piece

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
of office jargon in she will have to guess what it means if she loses she

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
drinks that piece of dumb office jargon that you have to decode

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
is double click double click why this is what

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I mean.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
I maybe what open it up to the possibilities like one would open the app.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Or a computer program. OK You know what that's close.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
What it is when one of them on the right

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
track is to open up

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
the full discussion or project on something that you are hoping to

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
breeze over them don't have to drink though.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Honestly I think you still should do feel like you are general. You're welcome. OK

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
well OK if you're passionate about revolutionizing the way companies operate

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
and love to get about things like the future of work and what makes teams awesome to get in touch with

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
August a consulting firm for the twenty first century.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Learn more at that Coles last another round that A.E.G. that see a

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
little slash another round

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
of free styling how what how

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
how does anybody even how is that a thing that humans can do

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
what part of Iran is like very very dense. It's something like it's

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
running or I repeated listening as you're always hearing something

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
no you know Davi who plays Jefferson is a one of the best technical rappers alive

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
if I listen to. Clipping and go I kind of knew I could throw anything at him and I.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Throwing crazier and crazier stuff at him just to see if you could do

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
it I can tap into guns and ships now and the last line I added was the line I

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
mean you got some thongs of leather but the sooner the better to get your right hand man back like I thought I was crazy. Originally

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I suppose I could have been with him in that but I was like we can fit another line.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I can write one

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
more one movie thank you so much is my

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
practical tactical gear but if I can get that

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
back in the right back to get the right hand back to the getting into my

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
hand you've got the better

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
guy and knife freestyle

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
backstage during a room where it happens on the meanwhile section when they're going

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Meanwhile at a stand it's bad news with the facts and not to be sure can

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
be settled like the oh my God I mean I happen

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
to be stage less together we always go freestyle and one of those was set up line and one of us will knock him

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
out and he goes out for his answer are you

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
fucking big That's like a bit of our backstage traffic he might have less talent

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
than some others a lot of times because it

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
keeps us awake. What have you learned about your brain through freestyle and it

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
really is like a filter. It's not like you're suddenly super fast with words it's like

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
you're channeling the part of your brain that deals with

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
language so through. Some kind of filter that finds the words that

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
rhyme and makes them rhyme at the end and that's that's the way I think of it when I hear this is gesture

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
and I

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
think OK I've got the last line and now I have to like keep it for myself and I've got the

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
funny line in my head and I'm just going to lead up to it and I try to work backwards and that took

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
a long time and

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
right let's talk a little bit about your generosity get some things

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
you think for you give us you give us some

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
credible work. Are you also do the hand for hands all the time you interact with everyone on Twitter

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
like how how how do you do it

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
all in all the time the energy rod when they have for him is

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
were really or I mean they are they're part generosity but they're also. Part selfishness

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
and like karma guarding when we did our first lotto on Broadway

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
seven hundred people showed up in the dead of summer and it was like oh we cannot send

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
six hundred and eighty people into the streets of New York mad that they

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
didn't win. That's right for our city bomber America nothing

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
easy and bad

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
for personal safety so I got up there spontaneously the first day and then Tommy Kail

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
was like we should do that every day we're in previous like bring here we are a lot of talented people here let's

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.000
just do like a little

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
something for the people outside who are trying to get a ticket and then that became the him for ham

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
show and kind of got bigger and kind of got crazier now that it's digital why we're making these

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
videos but it really came out of the fact that

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
like we can't give everyone tickets to the show and so what can

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
we give you that is sort of a token that you can't get anywhere else so it really sort of

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
came out of that like all right you're in New York and you

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
like tried out the lotto you didn't get to see the show but you saw tell you had a rapping Oh cool

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
day before yesterday I saw you know a gender flipped version of one of the songs in the

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
SO theaters exclusive and Doc said it's exclusive but it's also magic

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
because it's these people in this room experiencing this thing like I don't know a way around that it

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
isn't translating it to video were tricked like that's a form of translation it's not the

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
right thing.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
So it's about you know addressing that and acknowledging that while still protecting the thing inside

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
the building.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It's going to find.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Some a question you didn't have time for but that's cool because now comes some part

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
to have you going to adequately explain why his name in a club

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
he really liked if you know if this is Jeff I'm listening to the shelf life of Ali forgive you second of all this

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
is our rapid fire. QUESTION And

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
segment. So a lot of famous people have come to your show one of them is I want

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Kanye West we know the picture. Tell us everything.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Oh boy within like he was in the second row. Normally when when musicians come to

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
the show it's usually through Atlanta like we're trying to get them you know we're making this mix tape

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
where we've got hi guys are ready for this

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
next how to make you too much of the mixtape but I can tell you

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
that we're getting like artists to do like inspired by is where we're like chopping up songs from

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Hamilton and then the verse was on top I think I can tell you common

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
drop two

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
verses for us all right already is a like a crate on the minimus down to I ninety thousand but I'm going

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
to line up like that so I'd

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
like that's really exciting So anyway I say that to say that usually I know when an artist is coming

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
but Conny kind of just showed up but it was the day I think life Republicans do and he was in the second

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
row with him he had him he was in the second row

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
with him. I am not like that yes in that no I see all

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
the way to I can see about fifteen rows back there was and I had

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
a moment. Really there's a moment where we go is it a question of if Burr which one and

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I just basically I felt whoever's in the first two rows and I was at them and I'm just

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.000
like

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
hey that was like That's my little like one time I was

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Hamilton last time he single before he did allies adoptive family saying.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
OK OK OK

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
OK I just wink the hell out of

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Kanye because he was right in light of the blast

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
zone

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000
and so he was like you can give me want to yeah it was very cute All right.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And then. I have to tell you they came backstage at

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
intermission and so at intermission. I came downstairs and said This whole show is about you

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
and it's all about you and Washington's Jay Z. and you started writing for Daisy before he struck out on

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
your own like it's all about you and then he was like and the three

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
sisters and I was like yes and

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
the three sisters it's all about. He like totally He was really sweet.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Do you ever have a kani moment where. You're like I wish there was another me so I could watch

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
the show.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Well I mean I kind

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
of do. That's the thing like I have an alternate Javier Munoz who does the show Mondays and

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
he he's so good like me and he's really really good all in the show when Obama first

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
saw the show he saw

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
healthy because it was our six preview was my first time seeing the

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
show which is a crazy way to see your show for the first time we like to be

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
frightened and that was the

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
whole thing. Talk to us about that my gosh what is. What does the

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
president smell like the president smells like success.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
OK And I believe he was so I can show you some

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
pragmatism.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
So about that is my answer we've ever gotten to that question and I was like oh he didn't smell like

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
anything I'm like that's a lie. Yeah how can we not know I'm very I'm very small where I'm right with

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
you

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
not ask you I am really excited to ask this question. I feel like the would you rather that

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I have and least favorite part that's

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
not true. Oh good I'm just like they always throw me

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
off I get a very visceral reaction and I worry about

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
your brain sometimes that's on things would you

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
rather have a no that

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
pulsates like a human heart. Or have you

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
in that fizzes up like Alka Seltzer when in the

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
water or when water hits it sweat included. It's like if you start

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
sweating does the nose do that when in contact with water or that's just a sensor just like

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
the nose is just always like well like I already have that so I'll take that over in

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
the fall take it out over the alternative that I have the evil you know is that in that you really

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
don't have not seen your nails pulsate when since you've been here a while thank you

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
and later and then it gets bigger in my mind than everyone else is going to do when he was a few years ahead of the rest

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
of my

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
face right thinking of kids really great segue.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
You teach sometimes about

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
the girls you had crushes on going to school. What was your what was your game like back then and what's like the

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
worst way you've been curved by

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
go oh man I mean I kind of had a very prolific seventh grade.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
OK I play six girlfriends in seventh

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
grade and then like dry spell until the end of high school

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
I don't know what my thirteen year old game was like when a lot alike from Cross colors.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
I was aware and like denim shirts. Alright. And that was like when gap was wearing like

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
the color denim jeans and they were in red

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
and just up with cross colors.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
OK I'll tell you the most embarrassing when I wrote a whole movie just to have a kissing scene with this one girl

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I'm listening sexily listed on I.M.D.B..

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Because I.M.D.B. was less strict about

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
it's not good enough and so I

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
was sixteen year old sixteen years old and we made like this movie was like there's a there's a kissing scene and it's

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
very tastefully done would you be in my movie and she said yes but it

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
was not even room and did the Q. and we did the kissing scene and it's the worst. It's the well you

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
know worst. It's the worst only know I love the way

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
it's you know I just like I can't watch it like it just like everything that led up to it I remember how much I

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
was sweating that like old Can't even when can we find this new you cannot find

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
it it has been destroyed but she was never interested in me like that's my that's

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
my Gatsby like that's my life so I could I could win the three people it's hers and like Amanda

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
is never going to

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
like me have her like a daisy a day

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
even a Emma to relive let's OK what is. What is

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:37.000
drunk lane

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
like drunk Lynn is surprisingly alarmingly

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
lucid like the last minute but I gotta say I don't feel like yeah well

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
that's why you know that's why socialism in practice never really and then

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
I was like I was beyond that I was I didn't making sense until the

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
moment I am asleep. That's like me on the. Please

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
say I love you both but I still like those are the most irritating types of drunks. Oh

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
absolutely yeah yeah cuz later when I come relational a

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
guy so I think a

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
guy like you thinks. Yeah thanking Yankee is me and I'm

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
lit A.F. right. I don't believe you. He means what I think

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
of children

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
that this is an incredible has been

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
so what has been like begging for this with a long we made it how it was

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
so thank you on behalf of its leader and I mean having to

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
balance it out so where can people find your work and for people who are like the majority of

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
our audience who probably will not see your show or they will not see my show this year.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Yes The thing that's the thing I kind of try to counsel is like the fact that it's so hard to get a ticket means we're going

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
to run a really long time word like that I mean right. That means like all right you might not see

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
it in the first year you might be the original cast but

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
we're we got two tour companies happening in like record time we're like casting as

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
fast as we can for that we're trying to make them as good as the original

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
company and like we're just doing our best to like get it out into

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
the world possible I'm going to make the school productions happen fast. You just have to live that way years on the

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
try to get that to happen the next five years. Like I'm trying to get folks

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
to see it is seen as a can so for people

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
who will not be able to experience it in New York. Yeah like right now at its current iteration right.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
What is the best way to experience the

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
show cast album. OK. The cast album has all the songs on the show except for

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
it has like there's one moment that I'm saving for you for the theater

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
between your Theodosia and nonstop. That's that's like the one moment and

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
then also we have a

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
book that has the complete libretto and also these amazing essays by German

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
the Carter. It's my lyrics and then I did sort of these and notations of all of

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
the lyrics so I go into these crazy side bars and because genius dot com exists.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
It's not just this is a mob deep sample. This is rare and it's like I

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
was you know half asleep with my dog like my hands and I did.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Jean is a calm actually forced me to be more personal because I had to make the annotation something you couldn't get anywhere

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
else so that will go beyond April and it's a great companion piece. Now Matthew all the same in

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
the little pictures and where can people find you and for some they can find me on Twitter.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
All right and often too

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
often it's going to be almost like

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
yeah but you know what I think of it is the opposing muscle group of writing a

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
musical Hamilton took me seven years to write so why I like it so right that I the

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
runoffs is like me Tweeting like Tracy told us to

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.000
know that's that that's

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
another creative outlet but what is your Twitter the name of Man

are

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.000
at

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.000
home

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.000
dad

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
twenty minutes ago I honestly find this ran from On Heaven's Cloud who you run

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
around

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
for buying. Around for brussel sprouts. I'm listening

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I'm listening. There are a ton of food and I'm like I don't like those even though I've never had

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
any. Spinach was one. Fast forward to today

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
I love manage interest and as of like a few months ago I was like let me.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Maybe it's like a year ago. I actually remember where I was when it happened. Cynthia Gordy Prince

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Andrew gave me a girl Ritz Brussels sprout

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
a goodbye.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
I don't like oh my God why have I been denying myself. Honestly same they are

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
so good and they're just they're just

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
glad I didn't know and everyone a childhood cartoon that was like the example

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
of that was that it was I want to eat. So I was like Oh I trust all these kids you know

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
and even then this is

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
gross. I went to a restaurant called

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
surface to give rights with our different the kodo and Gene Demby was in

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
hand and colors like we're getting dressed like right

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
then and then like she she just like very silently slid a Brussels sprout on to

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
my playing about this brown.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
It was the best thing even like

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
the last like five months probably and it was just like it when

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
like covered in like season anything was unlike saute with like garlic and bacon.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
It wasn't like this we little

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
broth and stuff and I do it and just. I want to go right now and get more of

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
these Brussels sprouts interesting. So I set out to Brussels sprouts That's all I just really like

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
but each

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
aircraft. It's too UN around for us. I'm buying around for the dorm

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
team and I love them they kill. So yeah. So

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I don't randomly on Comedy Central's website and they have like the. Like web

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
series things. I had never heard

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
of but one of them I was like we were you six black writers who were always

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
wearing science and things happen to like this image.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
But they have a web series on Comedy Central called six guys one car.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
I love it and it's like they're. They're broke too. They're like on the show they

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
play You Tube personalities are like a group of do the You Tube channel

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
which they are in real life if you don't know about dorm Taman

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
people. You've probably already seen like a gif of theirs on the Internet so that when they lose the

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
one that I guarantee that you've seen is one of like a Lego crowd in the foreground in

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
the background is a black dude dancing in

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
LA and do nothing to be like will

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
celebrate in the back.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
I guarantee you you've seen some of their work and they've done like the art of the roast the

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
invisible girl dancing on the six guys are you seeing that. Yes well seem that way to

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Larry anyways so on the show they basically play like trumped up versions of themselves so

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
they have this

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
like You Tube nemesis named Larry. They're always in competition that they like

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
to live in L.A. and they're just trying to make it their language why is our manager so

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
shitty and like that sounds kind of like just like annoying

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
like you know teens on the web and you know like write downs not good but I

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
guarantee you I've laughed out loud several times all their

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
E.Q. like all of them each one of them bring something to the table. How is everybody in your group and

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
that never happens with a group of dude. Yeah

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
especially six of them right. They actually do make a good number of jokes about

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
how cigs is an unwillingness to do

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
anything but yeah it's such a fun series and I'm like why isn't this a full show

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Comedy Central you fucking up. Yeah they're like five minute episodes like I don't know why this is happening.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Let's take it out and I hope someone gives them a bigger show the slow web series.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Yeah stand up to them that I'm sane in Brussels sprouts there's a weekend. You know what else

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000
falls into the brussel sprouts category of food that you should eat but doesn't seem good.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Call of flour all I want is why have

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
broccoli and then I fucked up. I've been

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
fucking up for you I love cauliflower high flour is bomb there is so much. Can do with

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
it in one is sauté right listen my favorite thing is when white

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
people prepare cauliflower like chicken like the fellow cauliflower

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
listening for that was like Don't you dare pass something off as she can this not chicken right. But it's

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
not passive it's a whole other thing.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Yes I like it's like me and like I was like you

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000

percent with OK. I was still mistaken but your veggies. Yes I

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
