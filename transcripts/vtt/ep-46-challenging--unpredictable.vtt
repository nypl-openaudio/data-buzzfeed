well

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't call it

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
well I have no idea what that was well into the show feudalism it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
was welcome.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we had something scheduled to run today. But over the weekend we got an email that changed the course

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of events we got an email from friend of the show Melissa Harris Perry formerly of the Melissa

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Harris Perry show on M.S.N. B.C. and she said that he was ready to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
talk about her split from him as N.B.C. which is

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
very pretty heated and very public and I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
was the we were like Yeah when I mean like no we were like yeah because it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was a metal club special ed it's like oh if I see you broke my

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
will I was an incredible detailing of how we

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
felt. Yeah. So that's what's up today

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and you might remember that we interviewed her in an earlier episode we should definitely check that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
out but we don't try to get every every and every step

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of the T.V.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Today we're so without further

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
ado we have a very happy to welcome to the show Welcome back to shell Melissa Harris Perry

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
She is currently a professor at Wake Forest University where she runs

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
an adjudicator center and we are so honored that you are here with us today. Thanks for having me back

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
has gone well. I mean it wasn't that long after being with you all that it all ended

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so I'm assuming it was you

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
so. Yeah you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
could hear. I feel

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
like we need to do some background for people who might not know. All that's been happening. You wrote

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
a letter to your staff at nerd land which front of the show Jameel Smith published in medium where you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
say that quote here is the reality. Our show is taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of an election season for the people who have not been following the nitty gritty of this.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Can you give us your general timeline of events right so let me back up a little

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
bit too before actually before we got to January of two thousand and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
sixteen so M.F. and B.C. had undergone some programming changes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and we knew we were going into an election year and we wondered

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
what image the show's role was going to be and so I had been trying to have some conversations with the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
leadership

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
there and look on a real like basic level. I don't live in New York. I live in North

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Carolina and I fly up to New York on the weekends in order to do the shit I have been doing that for

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
four years. And so I have an apartment here and so like I don't really know how to face other than at the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
most basic level.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I want to know whether or not I should renew the lease on my apartment and my thing was if you think

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that for any reason the show is not going to make it the whole year.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Let me know I'll stay in hotels when I come because I don't want to be on the hook for an

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
apartment for the whole year and I really just can't get an answer from

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
anybody and eventually right as we got almost to the very start

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of the New

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Year got an answer that said no no we you know we expect that image the show is going

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to run the length of the contract which wasn't quite the whole year but would have been pretty

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
close to the also so who told us how long would it have been that was

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
my executive producer at the time who apparently believe that he had had

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
conversations with people the top no one thing it directly to me and that would run to the end of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
October but it seems we got to January started seeing

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
some changes and the big changes I think any viewer could have seen but it might have been a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
little bit harder you might have been looking for it there are things. We call tagging a branding.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So the way that you know or that you knew at every point before that you were watching Melissa Harris Perry

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
show is that it was particular colors. So is a particular blue and brown

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and it said Melissa Harris Perry on what we call the banners right so kind of along the top in the bottom.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We had a soundtrack like a particular music that we would come into and then if we

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
had like graphics or we had video they were all in what we would call our look right so that

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
name color and those sounds and all of

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that and if you go back and watch the shows in twenty sixteen starting in about the second week of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
January that all went away and nobody told us anything it just

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
went so they were still doing the show and just the graphics were different. That's right and initially we

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
thought that this was because of the Iowa caucuses and New

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Hampshire

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
primaries and so I started asking questions about when an H.P. branding was going to

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
come back and I asked that question because we went

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
missing and this is a bit of insider politics but we went missing from a space we

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
call our dome think of it as like a card catalog. So basically any time you want to go back

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and find something that you did on T.V. or that

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
another hosted on T.V. you can go and look in the card catalog the belongs

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
network by the date the time in the show right. You can say oh some listeners Kerry

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
did in you know January of two thousand and fourteen and you can go

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and find that list has very disappeared from our

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
home starting in twenty six team we were just place for politics ten A.M. to noon.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Did these changes happen with any other sales it was a just you are now basically with most of the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
show like with the branding and

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
everything all the weekend hours and all of the dayside So I

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
want to really clear wasn't it was personal in a lot of ways a very impersonal. But

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we disappeared we were gone and so it was real clear to me at that

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
point that we actually did not have a show I was still being allowed.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Host

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
initially but the show was gone and then the next thing that happened

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
was that I was no longer allowed to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
host so first the show last but I was still hosting the second thing that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
happened was there was some messing around editorial content and then the third thing that happened

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
was that I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
was no longer put on the schedule to host. What do you mean by messing around

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
with editorial content. So we had always been given a kind of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
wonderful level of editorial freedom.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You know there's rules about what you can and can't say on T.V. and there's guidance at any point you know these are the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
big stories of the week we expect you to touch on them in some

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
way but we also had always had things that we just kind

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of did we talk about poverty. We talked about sexuality we talked about sexual assault

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
on campus we talked about race we talk about a lot of pop culture those are things that

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
we felt like made our show the sink that was what made us the show and we begin

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to be

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
told not to book guests on those topics not to talk about those topics and

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to talk exclusively

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
about the election. The easiest example is

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
what happened on the what ended up being the very last show. That I hosted which

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
was rule Sunday. Every year that I had a show Super Bowl Sunday

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
we always had an early and Super Bowl Sunday. In fact

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
in most of those years I wore. Shoulder pads

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and another land Jersey and we talked a lot

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
about the Super Bowl kind of the way nerd land does it. So yeah we did a little bit of sports but

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
we did a lot of Race and Sports gender in sports you know. And see the play card

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
tell leading into the N.F.L. And you know that's kind of the way we we do things initially we're told

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
no more than an

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
hour that we were told no more than half an hour and then we were told kill the Super Bowl.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I said. Can the Super Bowl and Super Bowl Sunday. Besides the fact that I

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
thought that was actually. Like a bad ratings game. I mean I don't even really look at the ratings but I. I happen to know that

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
it always performed well for

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
us but then the other thing that happened that night of course everybody knows was Saturday

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
night formation

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
dropped and it's a holiday sidebar. Most are very

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
wearing the best T. and it was a credible teaser as beyond say surf team. It's

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
a great in on that it's new to feel that it's all

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
happening at every August.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It dropped and it was about everything from race and black lives matter and New Orleans all things that have

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
been central topics. To image the show so I mean I think I put up

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
a joke on Twitter that night and I was like oh we're trashing the

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
whole show you know we're starting over every I was joking we were dressing the whole show but obviously

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
we started rewriting scripts

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and one of the like well it's called third floor

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
people came in and said no and if they're full of arsenic like Ira.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Yeah yeah he said unless you can make this somehow

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
about the G.O.P. primary we're not going to have a conversation about B. and C. information

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
tomorrow and I said yes we are we've been talking about black lives matter we've been

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
talking about post Katrina New Orleans. We've been talking

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
frankly about beyond say we do it well it is critical to who we are and

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
my God beyond to just drop this on a Saturday

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
night we have a show tomorrow morning. Nobody else will have touched this. This is like a guy

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
like this is like a a gift from the T.V. god why did you not let us do this

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
of course we're going to do this

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and was told no no no for an hour to the point where I finally

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
said you know what cool. It seems to me that what you want is

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
not my show. If you want me to go on television act like

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
this isn't happening. You must want to anchor and I'm not an anchor. So I tell you what

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm going to I'm just going pack what ya'll good anchor will talk and I put my stuff in

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
my bag and I started walk

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
out somebody made a call to a higher higher up who at the time was on the ground in New Hampshire.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And that person sort of said OK lungs do more than two segments they can do it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And it roasted again. What was the reason that the third floor guy gave you for not wanting you to do

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the ONS I coverage. Also who was it. Oh Who was it who told us no. His name is

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Chris Pena amount of it means anything to anybody he's like his job is he oversees

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
weekend coverage.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I just from the cable news world of decision making I'd like it so I can read

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
it it is a collective effort to make T.V. and I sometimes have kind of wild and

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
crazy ideas and so them. Just like a good idea and that's fun. Like I want to be really

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
clear it should be collaborative it should be collective and you should check each other and it should just be groupthink and sometimes

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
we make mistakes because we didn't write it so that's

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
OK but that's different then something that was clearly in our wheel house being told simply

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
being told by

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a higher up not to do is that like their new tagline the place for politics what is this

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
direction they're going. So I can't tell you the answer to that and I can't tell you that it's wrong.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It might be great so I just want to be really clear about this too because I think this got a little lost in

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
all the

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
everything people who are at the top of

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the organization that is governed by Harkey have a right to change the

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
direction of the organization and so

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
when Andy Lack came to Miss N.B.C. and made a decision to take M S N B C In a new

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
direction and that direction was place for politics and it did not have room for beyond

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
say and Dave Zirin the conversation

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
on the Super Bowl. That is one hundred

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
percent

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
fine but it also needs to be made

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
explicit not only to me as a host. But to my team and to

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.000
my

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
viewers and so what happened was that conversation happened

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
internally we went on we did our show and then I was not invited back

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
to host and then for two weeks.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Not only during my regular time slot but at no point during

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
those week. X.. So for example we went straight from there to New Hampshire right from New Hampshire

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
primary happens on a Tuesday. I would normally have been on air on a Tuesday granite.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But every host and. Correspondent and people who don't even

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
have shows were in fact on the network on Tuesday. I was standing

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
in the room on Tuesday while television was being

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
made and I was not invited on air.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So no today is not my normal time slot but this keeps

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
getting described as like a couple weeks were preempted What is she so dramatic about the fact she

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
not what was happening. I was clearly one hundred percent being

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
told You are not invited to be part of political

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
coverage which again one hundred percent fine

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but rather than simply saying that there was nothing I was

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
asking questions I was sending e-mails I was telling people I literally one point was standing next to a

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
vet Miley who was my vice pres of standing next to

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
her and I said hey. Am I going to ever get on the air as you

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
have and kind of shrug your shoulders for the next two weeks go by I'm not making

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I probably just like what how did they like tell you to not come back to the show

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
after you did the beyond saving the Bianchi segment so the next week

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I'm told that there's no my image the show is a place for politics and

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
those hours and I just said like your show is not on the that's right they had an enormous it's place for politics

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
all those hours be hosted by someone else. Then the next

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
week it was play for politics there was my someone else. There's also at some point in which one of those two weeks.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
There was a sickly a funeral but they had be clear I had already been told.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I was not to be there was going to be part of those hours I was an be part of any of the

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
daytime evening. None of those hours at any

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
point then I get an e-mail from Dylan Byers at

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
C.N.N. So F. why I was made a little bit of a hard ass about

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
it so my response to. People behaving badly was to go on my

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Twitter and take M S N B C hose off my

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
bio been just a little like about it like I did. Well

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
saying I love her nothing else I don't get why. Yeah I just was I was like really young and put

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
me on air. I'm to take

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
off now. There's apparently like a little

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
algorithm and people can see when you change it for them but I had maybe not known

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
a lot of those moments like Go on you I had a fight like

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
it navigated right. We see you know the man. Yeah right.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I didn't quite what. Whatever. Yeah so I mean I just I just figure when different doesn't

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
make will. So do it by its doing his job his job is to report on

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the media and apparently he got to like him H.B.O. changed

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
her bio. So he's sent an email talking about I see you have really been on

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.000
the

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
T.V. and you know him as N.B.C. host is gone from your bio I guess you're

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
moving on and so my response was just. There the face being made in the studio that

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
you can't see. Right so I said nothing. So I said nothing for

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
like a day and a half and then I get another e-mail from Dylan says Hey

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I just talked to him I said we see this that everything is fine that he give

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
you a quote or just a general. No you just said they said everything is fine so I still just

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
said nothing felt like well that's interesting because they will answer my emails. All right where

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
they have to

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
deliver three or four days later

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
the grid for the weekend comes

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
out and my name is on it so after Dylan as

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
my name so I thought well this is Sting. Obviously my name in the name of the

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
show are the same thing. All right so I asked for clarification. I called my executive producer and

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
said My name is on the grid. Are we doing Melissa Harris Perry

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
show or am I just entering tend to new.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And he said you're just anchoring to new I said

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
How long is are going to be no Melissa Harris Perry show. Are we going to be able to come back

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
after Super Tuesday right because that was it could be another couple weeks and I was told at

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that point for the forseeable future. There's no most areas Barry's show.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You'll be put in. As a host when needed. And

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
again that is coming from my E.P. at that

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
point still have her had a conversation with. That was when

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I sent the message to my team because that's what my team was excited basing my name on

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
the lead singer how Thank God for. Were gone bad here we go.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yeah let's let's talk about like your

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
team through all this and their reaction sell like what was like the general conversation going on

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
within your team when like your sanity is being taken away and everybody started out as like OK

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
we haven't been on this show and

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
allow this is the one thing I cannot talk about because they're all still inside. So

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
everyone on the team still works there

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
They all got bills to pay. Yeah except for my E.P. who I feel

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
like is a grown ass man so he will have to give loans one way or another I don't

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
want to say anything about what any other team member said did or otherwise. Yeah. What I can say is I

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
don't believe that that letter leaked from any member of my

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
team. I sent that letter to my team but I also copied it to Yvette Miley and

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
to Phil Griffin. Because it because. M S N B C has been a

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
very leaky place and because it's been a place where people have not been very loyal.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I don't want to send that letter to my team and not have our bosses see it. I don't want people to

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
feel like oh my god this letter exists and our bosses haven't seen

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
it somebody my printed out left a

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
bio printer right

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
or or Phil Griffin got a call that me I as he clearly did on Friday

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
so what do you mean on Friday of

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
this week. Phil Griffin clearly. Called media told them that I had a job

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
with that I had signed a deal with fusion. But what does he stand to gain

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
from doing that I think the goal is to make it look like I wanted

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
to sever my relationship with M S N B C In order to potentially pursue not

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
new opportunities and so if I had signed a deal within two

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
weeks. It would look like I had purposely wanted to sever my relationship and I absolutely did

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
not let me see South are in it with

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
him the person who wrote

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
the piece is a guy who still has lunch with

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Ana basically on a weekly basis and the story was quite wrong.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Look I think fusion is kind of interesting place.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It's its quarterly it's got its problems and challenges there's no doubt about it but I actually think it's kind of.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I think it's kind of a fun place. And I would hate it if I did have that offer

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
from fusion and other conversations with lots of different people

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
about lots of different things but the idea that I was anywhere close to signing

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
is like is so bizarre really overstated So we're

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
way off base and then when I took to

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Twitter and I said basically L.O.L. media hype on this they came

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
back and said oh no

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
we've confirmed that it was former members of M H T's team.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
So they doubled down once they said that once I knew that it hadn't come from fusion.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
But instead had come from inside M S N B C that I knew immediately

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
what happened right so I know exactly what the track of that conversation was I

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
know how it got wrong. I know how it went from like I've had initial conversation that

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I'm excited about

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
to imageries about to sign a deal or as they initially reported it already had signed a deal and was

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
about to launch a show L.O.L. As like wow media. Could you be more wrong

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
but their their willingness to double down and be so certain about it has to do with their sense

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
of assurance about what that leak was in that

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
film so I don't really know. Where the an initial letter leap

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
from what I do know is that once it did once some parts of it were

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
in the New York Times I wanted all of it out and so that's when I sent it

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
to Jamil.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
You know who was the original nerd of nerd land. I sent it to him and I said hey

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
there are parts of this in The New York Times they're probably pretty inflammatory You know people going to read it

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
and think that I was saying one kind of thing. I just want people to be able to read the whole thing

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I'm going to hand it to you because I trust you to put it in wherever you think the right places and he put it I mean

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
the one thing that I now about the ng a black

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
person working in white

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
media is that once in Issue bubbles to the surface

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
are isolated otherwise especially if it's very silly to that little bitty bit that

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
where hearing about once it hit the headlines is like the tip of the iceberg of what else is

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
usually going on behind us and are.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Is this kind of the straw that broke the camel's back and wet. What is what has it been like to

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
work in math and easy life from day

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
one to the last day like what what is it like to work there as a as

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
a person of color.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
You know funny. It is not the worst place I have worked. It just is not by any stretch of the imagination.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I have to tell you just when I

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
wrote that e-mail to my team. It was more than anything an apology

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
to them that we were looking at another week two weeks three weeks

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
months six

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
months of them having to write T.V. that I know they hate to write.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Most of the members of my team came with real commitments to the

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
political social intellectual questions we were interested in working

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
on and so me making a decision

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
not to sit in that weekend with me saying

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Look in part because I believe that even if I came back we're still going to be doing.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Donald Trump up badly it would be good and I just I one girl say those words out of my

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
face it was we weren't like. The straw that broke the camel's back my when my

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Al was much more like

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
look I'm not going to do that right. So and he wants me to do

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
this I'm going to do that for you you'll have to decide you know let me do the thing I want to

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
do or but I want done and

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I'm I really want to go through this election and yeah there

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
were things about working to dimiss sure. But again it's actually not the worst place that

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
I've worked part of it is I come in on Friday night and I'm there Saturday and

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Sunday and so and I mostly just live a nerd land with a team full of

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
mostly lovely young black and brown women who are

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
mostly feminist

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and like identified all the questions that we're concerned with and so my world is

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.000
pretty

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
great

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
whenever things went bad and I became the subject of public

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
controversy. M.S. never. As a company.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
No one time they did. Very early on were supportive and helpful. Every time after

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
that that there was any kind of controversy. On the show it was completely

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
clear that the priority was to

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
protect and medicine. And that's his reputation. There was never much of any concern

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
about the personal

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
costs emotionally

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
fiscally

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
sometimes like literally in terms of safety. So to

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
accept that there was a straw that broke the cam on this

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
one you know there was a very scary encounter in Iowa. So what happened. So I was

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
in Iowa for the caucuses. And in part because M S N B C.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Wouldn't give me a press pass while we were there. I wasn't behind the M S N B

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
C security barriers. I was just sitting out in the hotel lobby to give you a press pass.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
No ma'am.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So I was there. And I was covering the caucuses with my twenty two kids from the wake the vote program right.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
So I'm traveling these twenty two kids are Democrats or Republicans are liberal conservative. I found them to work

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
for candidates across idiology So you draw from a hat. So you can be a

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.000
liberal working

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
for Trump or you know conservative work for Hillary on any given weekend right so we

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
were there and I was waiting for them to come

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
back from their caucuses. So we were sitting in the lobby and I was in there with a couple of

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
my other staff members and a man approached me. I've been meeting people all day

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
as you do at the caucuses. He came up to me and started talking and at first I thought

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
that we may be met before but then he became

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
aggressive and then he said something that I wasn't quite sure if I was meant to take it as a

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
threat or not. When he started speaking more loudly and he said I want you to

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
understand why I'm doing this.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I didn't know what he meant by this like what was the this that was that was about and

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I just froze.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I wrote I wrote about this because we will have to write blogs after after all of our

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
trips but then I heard the student starting to come back I kind of

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
clicked back

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
in I jumped up. I kind of moved put space between me and him one of my

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
staff members came and put herself between me and him we did some yelling he

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
went out the hotel lobby and was gone but it

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
was scary. It was scary it was upsetting the

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
biggest issue is I was then

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
going to New Hampshire the next weekend and I still had these twenty two kids with me and so then I wrote about

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
the story. Nena little mini viral a lot of people have very strong reactions to

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
it now imagine you're a parent and you know that your kid is traveling

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
with him H.P. and you've just read this story. Think of how you might

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
feel right presumably you might go. Well what are you going to make sure things

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
are better the next time. Right. So just after

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I wake forest immediately jumps to a variety of things they come they do a training with the

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
kids they come over to my office space there they put some card readers on it they

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
said I mean they're like OK hey we have a security breach here let's let's address

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
whatever it might be let's just start thinking strategically about

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
it

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
the response from M S N B C was if you're not traveling with us

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
if we haven't asked you to come as an anchor then your

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
security is

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
not our problem.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Wow And so I said Well. I've got twenty two kids traveling with me

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I want to watch the returns in a place I know I can just say to their parents. We're going

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
to be safe and they said no absolutely not can't

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
have all them damn kids up

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
here you have to go find another place to be.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
So we watched it in a bar across the street.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
It's not their responsibility. It's not their job but really nobody wants to harm me because I'm a

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
college professor the reason somebody wanted to harm me the reason that people send hate mail to me

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
the reason that I don't really my Twitter at replies for four

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
years is because I work for M S N B C. You know the reason my kid puts up with

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
stuff at school the reason my husband deals with mean that actually is because of ya'll And

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
so I'm just asking on this one day. Could I be able to tell the parents of

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
my kids that I know for certain that will be behind the security

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
perimeter because you know I've worked here for

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
hears and they their response is No

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
and I have to say that that level of

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
contempt from them towards me which I don't particularly think is racial I just literally think

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
they just simply did not

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
care was extremely painful and very hard to

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
take I didn't stop off and quit. I didn't it was like the straw that broke the

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
camel's back in that sense but it certainly was very revealing that I was in a I was working for.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.000
People

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
who truly did not care about me. Do you feel like

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
im is N.B.C.'s tendency to not be so supportive

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.000
of

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
its host and anchors when legs magickal is down is like par for the course or do you

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
feel like it was like because it was you they wouldn't come in like surround you are for the course nine

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
hundred ten par for the

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
course it does not feel personal my experience of this is not being targeted I don't feel

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I mean all of the targeting now that's what I'm talking right. And so were it will be

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
personal now but I'm inviting that

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
right that that's that's my my fault because I invited it by saying I'm going to

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
speak our colleague Joel Anderson tweeted something

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
that really resonated with me at this time he said we all know we're expendable but if most of

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Harry's Perry's expendable then we're really all expendable. I think it's very sweet of Joel

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
say I didn't know that anybody thought that way about the show.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Quite that fully until this happened. So I thought what we were doing in their land

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
mattered but

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I also recognize that ego is a real thing and so maybe you can think you're doing some real

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
special and actually you know. Did you like doing whatever is actually known

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
particularly notice that if it left. I thought we were doing

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
mattered and like to have people really articulate it.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Oh wow that has

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
been you know I don't go through it again I mean I would want to but I don't most go through it again

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
just because to have people articulate what we were doing

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
mattered to me I wish somehow could've been different than this I wish that

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
M.S.'s response had been to get that email and be like

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Oh that is why you should do a Ph D. in

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
political fire. It is totally ridiculous is that we were all what

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
about then having our land back girl like you

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
know I don't know that's you know in my magical thinking dreams what happens is Phil gets that email from

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
me on that Monday or Tuesday

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
and is like oh yeah that's right. When you and I met you were tenured professor

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Princeton

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
and of course you can speak on the election and we will be

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
happy to welcome you and the nerds back to ten to noon. Here's your

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
lovely field Lucette back here we go and it would have been a little blip.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
That happened and you know

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Instead they severed ties and we went forward.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
It seems like a lot is coming up for you right now. Yeah and I don't know how to

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
ask it feels like you're holding back a little what's

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000
like what's weighing on your spirit. Oh me that fellow looks like.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I knew would always be over in

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
fact my team used to hate it because I've always that it's my side as well.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
You know my real job is being a college professor for my team used to hate

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
that because it's their real

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
job and they gave silo much to it like I know

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
most people have no idea how T.V. is made but we're talking about people who came in

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.000
at ten A.M.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
on Wednesday mornings is when we start are making our shows and we would work

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
from ten A.M. on Wednesday mornings and they would be there sometimes till eight on Wednesday night and then back

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
again ten o'clock Thursday until it got Thursday night and

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
the Friday sometimes one of our producers in particular should be there.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
If their midnight on a Friday night been together and then again on Saturday night and by the time we

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
would leave on Sunday it was kind of a joke that we had because everybody would always make plans on

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Sunday like brunch plan. Nobody

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
could while I just did everyone was just dead on Sundays because

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
we would just give it all and we were not perfect and I could barely pronounce half

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
the names of my guests and sometimes we did weird segments that fell flat

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
and but God people worked so hard for

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
it and I just thought I thought we had one more year.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So a new would be over a new it wasn't everything a new T.V. was

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
always limited but I thought we had one more year about we make it to the election.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
We have to guess we still really wanted to get on there was unfinished business

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
and it was just over like. Boom.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Because your team helmet throughout is the Phantom to be supportive of the Union decision are they upset with you.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Things don't produce all of that. Yeah I mean probably all of that people are

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
human and some people probably

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
pay some people are probably just like why couldn't you

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
just walk in just do your job and do whatever was necessary and hold on because you

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
know some people are extremely patient like you know on a team of told

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
people lots of different personalities. Some of my team members are

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
like job which is like patient and just calm and quiet go

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
wait and probably would've just held out to see if by

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
June we got tired of play for politics and brought back the show

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
and figured you know what's the harm in a

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
little yuck it up while I was really now instead

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
of you know I said just not the chick i am i just can't

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I'm you know I'm old I'm forty two I'm old as compared to them and so for

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
me I just don't make apologies for who I am in my twenty's actually a might of

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
either apologize for being fast make my decision hormone to felt really

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
bad about it in some way but like the chick I am.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
I've always been real clear at this point about what my priorities are I try to

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
be raw honest with them about what my priorities were and that's what that's what that letter was that my letter was

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
me

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
trying to say I'm so sorry all I know that and know not everybody is going to

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.000
be down with

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
this but this is why. I was just trying to communicate to them this. This is why

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
even though my name's on the list I'm not going be on air this weekend. So I'm still kind of town understand what's happening at

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Amazon B.C.. Right now they're

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
responding to the response. To us being off air. I

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
was somebody named

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Gil

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
tell me everything that will get the black

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
It

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.000
should you

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
like. So

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
much so happy and I know what's

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
happening is so many of my like former knurling guess you know

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
thirty million like. Oh you know yo I haven't gotten a call since like you

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
know November isn't my twenty fifteenth whenever I'm all of a sudden I'm

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
getting calls and you know is it OK with you my gosh it's OK if you go on please go

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
on reaching back out to your guest to book them again and his thing and just a little

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
blow that he's acquired. Oh yeah as a whole bunch of things happen so we trended that

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
night for like six hours or something. And then Congressman Gutierrez

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
is got on the House floor with a little

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
sign this A has taken this in D.C. so white and

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
black terrorist act.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So appreciative and I think he may

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
be a little bit hair reminded them that when Comcast acquired N.B.C.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Universal that part of that deal which was approved by

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Congress included a memorandum of understanding about diversity.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So the disappearance of an H.P. show and

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
of do not bring back Alex Wagner and with a Diaz Balart not being on

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
air might represent a violation of the Comcast Universal deal.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
So right now and with N.B.C. is not looking to have bed and

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I'd bet that you're going to see more commentators and

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
guess maybe even hosts maybe even a weekend show

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
with people of color. Back to pick it up back up what you do

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
know and so part of this is that M S N B C is kind

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
of they treat everyone the same with the same level of

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
distance or what were you saying about treat many people that way and then there are a

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
few special people. OK yes but but I would say many people are treated

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
that way and that it is not exclusively a question of hosts of color. OK

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
so that's what I'm trying to isolate is the part because in your letter you said I'm not a token ma'am your

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
little brown bubble head. That's very rich. Well that's because I'm black.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
I think the outcry that they were concerned about was a racialized one and I think this is

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
the thing that is irritating to me consistently about him is his response to

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
this when they keep saying we know everything was fine.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I think it's both true and not true.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
I don't think Imus N.B.C. had any intention of firing

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
me and I think it's pretty clear that if I had been willing to be an interchangeable

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
anchor willing to go on at any given hour and talk about whatever they wanted that I

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.000
could have kept my

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
job

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I was not willing to do that so when I talk about being a little brown bottle head that's what that role

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
is I am brown and have a big head. So that's why

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
that's what that is when I'm talking about being a mammy that's a very specific thing that I'm talking

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
about for me want to mammy is what historically a mammy is conceived to

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
be the mammy is the worker in the household who cares more about the

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
master's family that about her own home. She's want to leave her family

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
behind in order to make sure that his family is dealt with that

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
his wife and kids and household are clean and in perfect order

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
that all things are right there and and is not worried about her

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
own what I understood in the

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Lagan Phil Griffin in the leadership at M S N B C to be asking me

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
to do

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
was to appear on air. In my

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
time slot and therefore confuse nerd land watchers.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
So they thought that we still had a show even though I could no

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
longer bring them the content which we have seen in their response to

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
our cancellation they were telling me was

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
important I don't think I and what people thought was so

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
important I think you know most local anchors

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
are pretty brown girls.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
What I understand people to be saying was important about him each piece show was what we were

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
doing and what I was being told to do was to leave my family behind

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
to leave him H.-P. show to leave nerd land and to appear on

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
air in order to make any LAX house look an order. That

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I was not willing to do and I'm still not willing to do it

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
now was I willing to be on any LAX network in order.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
With my show you even if it had been a bit of an island. Yep because I don't have to

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
control everybody's everything. If I can just if I had my space we were going to do it.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
But that space had been gone it was taken and he was an offer no one was offering that bag.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So the argument here is one we keep talking past each other where they keep saying everything was fine.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
No I wasn't asking for my job I wasn't asking for can I be here. I

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
was asking for your LAN and

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
that was something that was clearly not on the table they weren't letting us have it. Do you see

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
a future for yourself in cable news or a future for

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
cable news. Seriously.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
I feel like I'm in the middle of a really painful divorce and you're asking me if I'm going to get married

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
again I don't think

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
so you know cable news will go on for a while there's a lot of money in it and people

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
still turn to election year and so you know but is it is on a secular deathtrap.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And sure yeah all of cable is right. You know my kid doesn't know what time any

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
television show comes on because she gets all of it on demand and variety and right. You know Pod

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
but like in the short term will cable live sure those infrastructure that will create

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
that you know by the time it's gone. I will of already age out I'm a woman so I'm almost

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
done being allowed to be in front of a camera. Anyway.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Well that's you know it's a painful reality just that's just what's real Yeah I mean the one

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
good thing about this whole thing is I have been hungry for four years and so I might just start

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
having a sandwich and try to get a radio

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
show. I don't

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
know what I have found is a television very powerful

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
but yeah I'm not looking to be on T.V.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
again in any kind of regular way right away the number one thing

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
that television killed for me was writing. I still write all the time and I have two books in the works

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
that have been just languishing

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
and I've got to earn a living somehow so below my professor real job.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I'll need to do some other kind of work and I

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
would love to have some kind of platform that allows me to bring and convene all those voices that

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
I cared so much about in our

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
land. But on cable T.V. I don't really want to work for somebody again right

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
now you know. Have you heard of

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
putting up I guess the same

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
for you know I need a drink look at it though right. I think I'd

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
agree writing is the like at the moment the number one thing I love. I'd love to be doing weight of writing in them

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
so I feel like election time is when cable news is most relevant Yes. How do

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
you see the like direction M S N B C is going. I did have a little bit of a heart

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
attack on Friday night

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
was when the Chicago protesters shut down the Trump. Rally.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
It was the first time that I didn't just miss my team like in a general

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
way but had an

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
actual

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
like. I'm whining because I

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
was pissed that I didn't have a show of Saturday morning

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
because I just I was raging to my husband I was like Do you

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
know what we would have done with

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
this like. What do you think your show would have brought that Imus and he doesn't have

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
no we would have done the history of protest in Chicago. Like I

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
started doing it on Twitter and I just had to stop at the stop and

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
drank so because my immediate response to it was to go right in a block

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
right so my first thought was Oh my God we have to go back to the one thousand nine hundred races

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
riot and we have to start with how that happened. What it was who died in it and then we got to

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
come up to the one hundred sixty eight D.N.C. convention and sort of what the police response

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
is there and the fact that actually Democrats where it

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
happens and sort of the whole language about protesters as

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
violent and then we've got to then we have to come to this moment with the Trump rally and then

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
we have to sort of peel apart the whole language of violence

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
because this is like the mistake that's been made from Ferguson forward is the the

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
idea that property crime equals violence and confusion about what

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
constitutes violence and who's actually threatened and whose bodies

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
are constantly under surveillance under threat of violence and what does it mean to be young

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
and black and living on the South Side of Chicago and what

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
has the threat of violence look like there and how is Rahm Emanuel part of that like I just had a

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
whole the things just drawing itself in my head but then also what's been nice

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
is that over all these years.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Something like that starts to form up. But then I didn't have to do it alone so something like that would happen and then I would get on the

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
phone or I'd be sitting there and I go in and I sit down on the couch in the producer's room and

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I'd start a dialogue and

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
then like you know. Tracy or Rachel or me or and we'd start doing it

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
together and then they would have offered something and then we would have had some kind of beautiful

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
wonderful thing and we would have

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
called clearly to call Jelani and we to call Phelim Asia and then

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
this thing would happen on T.V.. And we just right

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
and then that did happen.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
What do you make of their trump coverage. I mean I watch. I don't watch the networks and

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I mean. Again

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
you divorce you drop a self. Yeah it's like you know you know if that is the gram right

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
away

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
you really haven't even it. You know I don't I

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
think the joy is when doing a lot of my hours I'm you know and I the one thing I'll say is

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I trust and love joy deeply thank God And she's

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
good to my team joint least treat what we do with

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
respect as a matter of example the weekend that everything was blowing up

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
and joy I was sitting in my

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
chair was because I was in my chair sitting in my chair at that

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
point and she did an interview that was the office we can get an interview with Ava

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Duvernay who just mentioned my name. She said something like.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
We're we're in Flint doing the flint.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Concert because we you know we have to hear from voices that are often on

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
her which is you know kind of what Melissa's show

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
does and they pull the interview.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And they didn't play

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
it

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
and Eva tweeted. You didn't know so they had

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
three taped

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
it so it would treated you like you know jump on my

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
interview and then M.S. is responsible. And they played it three o'clock in

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
the afternoon. You tweeted about your former

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
colleagues like Martin Bashir and Tori and said I'm sorry for and

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
ashamed of my earlier silence I gave into a culture of fear and Imus and B. C. you know

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
what do you mean by that so. Like I was just pointing out about that it was different

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
when someone's gone you never spoke to say their name again like you never existed. It

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
is unspoken rule is this like in like what the whole in a

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
the interview. How else does the culture of fear manifest itself

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
or you know you have to sign a none of. Those are when you leave if you

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
want a severance if you want to pay out and I just I wouldn't.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
So no one ever talks about it later

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
because because you find a way or ability to talk about

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
it yeah I do think when people don't sign these wanted disclosure things it's very empowering to

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
everyone else. For example there's that engineer at Twitter who also did

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.000
not

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
sign a non-disclosure and he was saying all these frustrations he had about the

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
lack of diversity in upper management. I'm not sure if it necessarily always

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.000
leads

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
to more people speaking out especially because there's money

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
involved but I felt empowered I felt heard. Because what Joel

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
is saying basically about feeling expendable. I presume mostly I appear to

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
be challenging them

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
predictable but I'm a feminist so I'm

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
down like I have to really want to teach or for a tattoo that so challenging and

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
predictable like to do that I'll be a great way to Hell yeah like the title. My next

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
book only challenging the predictable chicks make history books.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Let me just be really clear the reason I wouldn't sign that N.D.A. was because I want to talk about him

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
is that. I wouldn't sign it because I'm

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000
an academic even in my very first book before everyone thought about a T.V. show.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
I wrote about race in the media the word BT is in my first book

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
writers Barbershops Bibles and BT It's what I write

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
about I could not have an agreement disclosed. I mean

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
that the closed off the possibility that I could write about anything

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
ever so I I wasn't leaving mad I was leaving hurt. Sure because I wanted my show to go

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
on but I wasn't mad and I was mean particular interested in saying that name or Phil's name

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
and like a really literally wasn't just next.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
So I went to the bargaining table with them. With look and about

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
whatever but I'm not that mad. I really just couldn't go out with my. Thing is I'm just I'm not going to

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
find the nondisclosure I'm not confined in a spiritual not going to sign any of that because one thing I have

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
to be able to do is

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
write speak on it so we can talk about anything else you want talk about but that's one thing I can't and

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
they just came in me and then they came at me publicly and then they called me now and then they tried to play

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
me like I was crazy and what do you mean how did they come you will so. So then they just like when you can't have

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
this you can't have that

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
and let's be clear I mean I made more money than I've ever made in my life that I never made very much money because

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
I'm a working class girl and an academic and so for me never made much money but compared

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
to what many people make and make

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
their I make very little and so

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
I asked for some very simple things.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
So when they decided to both

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
fight in a really nasty way. About

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
very tiny dollars tiny to them that are really huge to

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
me and when they went into the press in ways that

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
were quite clearly dishonest rather than just saying hey

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
severing it's all

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
good at that point I was like oh.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Not only do you want to end the show you also want to make it impossible for me to work anywhere else.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
It's in your interests now to disparage

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
me doesn't make me dishonest in anything on thing it does

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
make me want to talk about things I would never otherwise talked about. Yeah I notice you tweeted like right at five

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.000
P.M.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
when when you were legally allowed to

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
think that was an incredible treat storm I think a lot of people have dreamed of going out in a blaze

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
of glory like where you're just like oh here's Angela

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Bassett setting fire to how I feel you know if.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Would you have done anything

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:59.000
differently.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
I

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
mean I've done lots of things differently but they were all about the show not about

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
believing I think I said if I found the i've never watched the show. And so one of things I've been doing

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
lately is watching it. Oh my God I would totally have done this differently or that differently out

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
or written this segment differently.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
So it's a little bit like you know deadlines focus us. So if I had known. We

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
only had just these four years.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
I might have made some different choices if I had realized how just how short life of the show

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
was but I sent that email because I believed it in the end. Yeah I would have

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
put fill in vet and Andy Lack on blast about their choices because I

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
felt like they tried to disparage my character which I think

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
was unfair and dishonest.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
I think I would still say every day that hosting that show for four years was

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
an incredible incredible incredible honor and like

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
like just the craziest thing that ever happened in my life that I never thought would happen and like

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I still like I look at my two year old I think mansion not she will not believe in a mommy attitude

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
like my fourteen year old will be like yeah no really she had a T.V. show like it was

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
incredible that any of that ever happened. This whole process sounds incredibly

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
draining stressful. I can't even really imagine

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
especially with such a public attack of character I

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
guess or up a public discussion of

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
character as they might

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
say How do you take care of yourself. I mean not well right now like it's you

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
know we're in we're in the middle of it like it's I'm it is bad right

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
now and I recognize that and know that you know on the

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
other side of it will be better. Like you know my poor husband he just takes all.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
All the crazy

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
because I just was yelling at him and he's like you know I'm just I'm just like sitting

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
here right now

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.000
but but he loves with additional. You know I feel he will fire me.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Yeah I mean at the moment like not well like you know not eating right I stayed up

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
way too late drinking coffee thank God I don't smoke

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000
a B. my darned ass is like my garden got

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
together. Which was good because the weather was good.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Are you angry. Oh Sundays Yeah. Mostly I'm hard but yes there are moments when I'm angry.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
There's moments I can feel like. I woke up the other day and I said to James I like this really

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
happened right like this like it happened. Like I

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
didn't even know this really happened and what did your

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
daughter know about everything eldest daughter. I think she feels sad

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
that like because she likes the

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
T.V. of like keeping her son from I mean she's even that impressed by

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000
it but she's like everyone's was like that they're all like has a T.V. show where you're

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
eighteen right. I will say the single best response out of all of it.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
This is OK second home on the weekends like you should like

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
if I have sleepovers. I like as you like

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000
oh well so like I want the longer response was like Oh so now.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Now we have week in

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000
fact somebody said some to James about oh well you know obviously that's Easter Sunday and

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000
she was like oh my god Easter Christmas Easter and for years

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
like there there are these funny things that we had just kind of given up as a family that we're going to be able

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
to really discover hopefully So Easter and sleep overs

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
and I don't know how many kids complete over gives me the last check

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
but I really want the outlet I

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
don't want to do it

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
because I'm fine I'm not a civil rights case.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
I'm not I don't want anybody to march on

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
nothing like I know that happens sometimes people I don't get to and therefore no

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000
no I'm. Actually not a cause. Please don't make me.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
There go to flit go to like the real horrible shit

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
happening the world. I am a relatively well off way over educated

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
black girl who had like a job that now has seven. I'm

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
fine but I do think is not fine. Is that the end of the

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
show means end of a space where a lot of voices

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
otherwise

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
can't be I do

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000
think mass media has a responsibility to put those voices there. I don't care if

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
I'm not on there. I want those people there. What I do hope is an

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
outcry about nerd land

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
forces encourages emphasizes.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Pushes people who do have a platform to say wait a minute there

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
is room. Interest and an audience for this thing.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
So whether I ever have another cable show is pretty irrelevant.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
But like whether or not you ever see all those like slightly

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000
quirky rumpled Why is this person on T.V. and yet to him that

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
was smart people on

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
air just call me out on hand my Rolodex please call my people please put them back out

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
there

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000
you know. Please remember that it doesn't have to be like a says heterosexual white

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
boy talking about politics like you just

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
simply try a little tiny bit harder. Try.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
That much harder to find somebody else to have the conversation. Not at

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
the basic

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
effort gray and now to try

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
and I'm very excited to

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000

round comes from August a new kind of consulting company that's starting a revolution in the

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
way organizations work from helping leaders embrace change to creating a culture where expectations

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
are clear and purposeful which brings us to a game we call interviews from the

reality God. Yes I asked Tracy an incredibly

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
ridiculous job interview question that an actual business is actually

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
use in an interview and if I like a really stupid answer. She'll get made up job.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
A I don't like it she's got a drank and yeah I feel ya you ready trays.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000

sombrero only in my dreams.

Hey listeners of another round. This is John always Berman.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
I don't like to speak in microphones. I like to produce crowd casts I'm one of

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
the producers of this show but I'm here because it's late Monday night have been Tracy have

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
gone home. We're trying to finish this episode for Tuesday morning and we wanted to make sure

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
that we gave them ascendancy a chance to

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
respond to some of the of the claims

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
that Melissa made on today's show. We just got a statement from our current bio the senior vice

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
president over at N.B.C.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Universal and here's what he has to say we're proud of the diverse

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
backgrounds of M S N B C's journalists hosts and analysts will gladly put that up against everyone

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
else in the news business. We're also proud that Imus and B.B.C. identified Melissa as unique

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
voice four years ago gave her a platform and stuck with

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
her and despite her glimpse of the contrary it absolutely would have

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
continued had she not sent a destructive e-mail the M H P show with the plain

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
and simple. It was not being cancelled or even altered and there was no consideration of

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
that were surprised and sad about how this ended but we wish her the

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
best and we did it again in a oh my goodness.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Who or what do you want around for it occurred to me that my little sister does not know

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
the ludicrous that I

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
know saying about Luke Chris has

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
turned into more of a like he shows up at a random award show what do you do

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
when a really nice to see that yeah.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Whereas you know the South really had a moment and Rav and I feel like he

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
was a big part of it not the

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
only part rare but you know and I kind of mixture.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Yeah I kind of miss more comedy in rap and ludicrous

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000
is definitely one of those people. Yeah you men who let these hoes in my room.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Do what it's that include me let a little bit in

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
my room and just let him

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
then end up being made a lot of. Plans and he did and he had a lot of fun music

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
videos like he really I think. Enjoyed the comedy of rap. Yeah I think a lot

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
of people still do but just not it doesn't feel the same playful

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
way that he did it also his hair was just it when people read oh bull just

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
like the most beautiful Afro I've

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
ever made and it seemed natural had been out when he

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
was out. Yeah I'm sure you do want to say I mean mostly they're in cornrows but when he left

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
that it was that it was an ordeal. But also like a big

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
nappy as Halo they will not

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
be the

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
case but. I feel like.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
People might forget that she's actually skilled Yeah he's of the really good rapper. So I recommend

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
you go back and listen to chicken and liquor the Southern Fried intro is a good place to

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
start is an intro.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000

attributes of whiskey that I really really like colorful and it just looks bad as

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
when you're at a bar. Last a die flicker in like it's sweet in the

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
