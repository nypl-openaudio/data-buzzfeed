guns in the truck and in the glove box me Mr Roemer fair. That is a fair

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
question to ask you. You just made that up.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I didn't. I'm just worried about heroes.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Said is that I was about as like I do not believe what does happen this man has committed an armed

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
robbery which is the villain. Of which is a felony that on this industry Tonight bombshell the starting

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
is guess he's OK. There you can have become of me but first I want you to stay in your car. I need to call for backup.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I was Bob's on the radio right cos a back up there's a SWAT team there's like

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
a you gotta low early thing and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
got helicopter like. And like they say around

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the car they got guns pointed at him and I was the why did they need the helicopter we know where he is

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
now can't. Yeah cause. Actually we do Mom he does like to make a scene and so they've

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
got him surrounded right. And then they

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
start to ease drama of the car and they pull him over to like this have their own knees and down they're like OK sir stay

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
here while we search your car they go and they search the car.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The car the look in the glove box is no good in glove bought a little back seat there's no stolen money

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
no

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
selling where you really

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
look in the trunk the trunk is empty there like a spare and like a crowbar in it and so

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
another cop walks up to Jerome and that like so you. We were told that you just robbed

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
like a bank or something you got goods but we didn't find any of the stuff in there

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the man said yeah and I bet that's like a man and cops that I was be

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
do but

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
OTOH Shas so much. I know that I'm not about to you

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
know build your own cases not black because he did have a situation to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
live depressing

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
was the way to bring down the job. I mean the fact that

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
he was so bold to even do that right I mean

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
yesterday was. Yeah I think that was like an intro. I think it will remember

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Larry right

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000
or wrong. Look at Obama's America.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We're

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
going to take a quick break go pay some bills etc I guess on refills. And when

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
we come back you're going to hear from Madea Maharajah who is an incredible human rights

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
activist support for another round comes from August a new kind

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
of consulting company that's starting a revolution in the way organizations work from helping leaders and.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Race changed to creating a culture where teens can thrive. Which brings us to our first and probably

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
last installment of Master workplace

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
theater Tracy and I will take a real life workplace situation and transform it

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
into super

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
dramatic unnecessarily dramatic radio

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
voice

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
this week on Master workplace theater we find truth in a small meeting with her team members her

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
coworkers family stands up and presents an

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
idea. And that's why I think all environmental statistics going forward should

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
sync up with Marsh's team before going live

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
bloody Stanley is this true. Did you steal this idea

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
from Tracy.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Maybe I did. Maybe I'm bad real bad maybe I'm on here. Maybe

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000

Tracy Stanley I'm flattered that you like mad enough to feel

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it but we should make a point to keep communication open across the team. OK now let's

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So we are very excited to have Mary Our home was in the studio right now she's a

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
human rights activist the co-director of the Gulf Center for Human Rights. She currently lives in

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Denmark and is also a Bahraini citizen who played an instrumental role in the protests taking

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
place in Bahrain in February of two thousand and

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
eleven was probably one of the smaller Arab Spring countries that people didn't pay attention

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to but those protests triggered a government response of widespread

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
extrajudicial killings arrest torture and more to suppress voices for

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
reform so that when something we should be paying attention to and despite being in exile she's emerged

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
as as a leading voice for human rights and political reform and behaving in the Gulf

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
region. Welcome to the show. Thank you you're known all over the world as

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
this incredible activist. But we want to start with baby Miriam.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
What were you like as a kid I was very

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
stubborn very hard headed. I gave my sisters a very difficult time.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
My older sisters one of whom was currently in prison actually were responsible for taking us to school.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I always made sure we were late. I would find any fence on the way to school

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and rumbling through it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I guess it was a way because I was very small in size I felt like I had to make up for it

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
in personality cells pretty much what I did. Where did you grow up

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and Copenhagen until I was fourteen and then we moved to the high in two thousand and one then Mark is pretty

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
white right.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah. And we grew up in halter which is right outside of Copenhagen and we were

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
the only brown family the entire town that like I mean traumatic.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I mean I was told pretty much every day to go

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
back to where I come from I mean even as a child that's something we heard over and over again.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I watched my mother not being allowed to get on the bus lines.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
If we walk into a store we go followed around as if they know that we're going to steal something so

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
things like that pretty much were you very aware of not being white like as a kid

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
doesn't Lee I mean we grew up in a small behind me society if I can put it that way we were

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
twenty one behind families in Copenhagen and women every

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Saturday. Oh yeah. It was a nightmare but now that I think about it you know I think that I was

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.000
actually

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
a good thing because we held onto our identity and I think that one of the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
reasons that I actually decided to wear the headscarf was because I felt like it

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
was me standing up to the Danish society me saying that I know

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that you don't want me to wear this so I'm going to wear it just because I can and so it

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
was the headscarf was more of a statement than anything else it's also helped me to learn

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
about myself I mean wearing the headscarf forced put me in a situation

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
where I was forced to explain where I was from and who I was constantly

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
because people always ask you why you were a scarf and why you dress that way and I'd have to actually be able

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
to present a valid argument. And so that actually helped me growing up to learn

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
about myself about my culture about my religion where I came from why we did things

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
now when I went back to the high and I realize that it was a whole different

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
issue and definitely not what I had grown up to believe it was was I

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
was one of the things that I realized after I moved back to behind is

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that Muslims on the outside of the Muslim countries are actually a lot more

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Islam make the people inside the Muslim countries. So what it means is

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that because you're like I explained because you grew up in societies where you are forced to

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
explain yourself over and over again and to understand why you do things the way you do them.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It also teaches you about religion and so you actually read you actually go and find out why you

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
do things the way you do because you have to explain it but when I when we move back to behind

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I realize that that wasn't the case over there. I mean yes there were people who understood but generally people did

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
things because they grew up thinking that they're supposed to do it because I was part of society.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I remember. One of like my most vivid memories of one of the first things that happened when I started to acting was

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
behind his and behind

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
was they were shocked that I prayed that I wear the headscarf and that I didn't have a million boyfriends

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.000
on the

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
mark and so this like this entire scenario for me was I was very struck by

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
its I didn't really know how to deal with it either. Did you like living very.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
No I was one of those teenagers who was always very angry. So I was you know

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I love. I love listening to Tupac me against the

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
world and so I always felt like I had

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
been a huge or really bad decision to go to behind from Denmark

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
as much as I hated the more growing up when I moved to behind I felt like I didn't belong

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
there either because we grew up in the society the community that we grew up in Denmark.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
We were taught that behind was home. That's where we belong. That's where we're and we go there that's

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
our people that's where you feel like you're now at home so going to behave and finding out that I

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
didn't belong there either was a huge shock for me right and going to high school

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and being called the dame by all the other behaviors through the child.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So where do you consider home like where is home for you. I'm not sure I

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
mean I guess the melodramatic thing to say would be the airport since I'm from the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
month but I'm not going to say that I'm not sure I think that the one place

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
where I've actually been and that I'm not just saying this because we're doing a show in New York

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
was actually the only place I've been where I actually felt like people didn't look at me like I stood

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
out was Brooklyn also employees right could walk around and feel like

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
well everyone's The front is a place where I could actually fit and yeah but otherwise I don't

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
think that I feel like anywhere really is home. So you have a very grown up.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Job like being a human rights activists is a very adult grown up thing when you were

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
little before you knew what that was before you knew what that meant what did you want to be when you grew

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
up both my parents are activists and we grew up in an activist home and.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You know one of the things that our parents would tell us before we went to sleep

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
is you need to ask yourself a question every night which is what have I done today

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that makes this world a better place and if you can name one thing the new voice that a day that's heavy

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
for some and so this is something I mean that we grew up with and we

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
constantly heard about the struggle we constantly heard about

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
because my uncle was a political prisoner for seven years and behind and he

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
was severely

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
tortured and so we grew up hearing all these stories about the atrocities that were being committed and

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
behind and so I think that it was always a part of us and when we moved back to behind my father was in and out of

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
prison I watched him getting beaten up by riot police several

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
times and so it was it was always part of the family it was

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
something that we lived with and it wasn't much of a choice that being said

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I grew very disenchanted with the human rights work to be honest during from two thousand and one to two

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
thousand love

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and I watched my father getting beaten up I watched him you know trying to organize

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and trying to build a grassroots human rights

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
movement and I saw how they would be about twelve to twenty people going out to protest and getting beaten up

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and thrown in prison and nobody cared I mean when I talk about it with anyone in behind they say yell but your

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
father is a

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
troublemaker and so I used to go up to my father and say I don't understand why you're doing us like

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
what's the point you can change things for people if they don't want to change you can't force people to

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
want human rights or democracy and he used to always smile and say One day you'll understand.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
It was only in two thousand and eleven when I was there for the uprising and I watched

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
people getting shot and killed and I documented those

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
cases that's when I had a newfound respect for the behind the people because

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I suddenly understood what it meant to go through an experience like that like people

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
had in the one nine hundred ninety S. during the last uprising and so suddenly I understood why people had become

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
so apolitical in that sense with that they didn't want things to go back to the

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
one nine hundred ninety S.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So for people who may not know about the Bahraini gun. A man or monarchy or

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
anything can you give us a little bit of background about what it was like before two thousand and eleven and then what it was like

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
during the so-called Arab

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Spring so Button's an absolute monarchy which means that the king and the ruling families above

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the Constitution it means that they can do whatever they want and there's no one counts ability there's a lot of

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
corruption there in complete control politically and

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
economically and so behind which is an oil rich country

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
has poverty and has high rates of

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
unemployment and so when people went to the streets in two thousand and eleven the

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
main demands was a constitution that was agreed upon by the people and the

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
monarchy and that they would have basic fun and fundamental Civil and Political Rights.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So this was the main demand of the protests in two thousand love and now after it's people started getting killed on

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
the streets for making those demands it shifted to well the monarchy needs to step down.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Can you describe what it was like then because I feel like the Arab Spring happened and I kind

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
of I saw the emotional swell but I felt very disconnected

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.000
from

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
it I thought for listeners who may not know what is Arab Spring. So the Arab Spring I don't really like the

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
term Arab Spring but so the Arab Spring is the uprisings that happen in

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the Middle East and North Africa demanding political change and fundamental

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.000
human

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
rights that started in Tunisia when Boise set himself on fire

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
after having

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
been slaughtered by a police officer he was a vendor selling things on the streets and he got slapped

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
and because of that he set himself on fire he basically reached a point where he just couldn't take it anymore.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
This is one of the things that we continuously go back to is that these revolutions rubout dignity.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
It was about people who are living for such a long time in situations

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
where their dignity was stripped away from

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
them and you don't understand what that means until you've actually tried it until

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
you're in a situation where you know that a police officer can come up to

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
you slap you beat you push you around see whatever they want and you can do absolutely

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
nothing about it and this is what then cause the uprising in Tunisia which led to.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The president fleeing the

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
country and then of course ignited the uprising the revolution in

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Egypt and then behind was actually the third and then Yemen

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and Syria. So I grew up in Ethiopia. Well I was born in Europe and I moved to America. It's very

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
hard to describe to people what it's like growing up under a government where phrases like the walls

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
have ears. Is incredibly important to learn very

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
young What was your relationship like to even discussing

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
politics because of the way my father isn't because of the way my mother raised us I was

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
a really used to having much of a filter which is definitely something

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
that you need to learn to have I mean during the last trip that I made to behind when I

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
got arrested.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I remember just having to teach myself or reteach myself to remember

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
what I can and cannot say specially while I was in prison and I did make a couple of the

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
things that I could have paid a huge price

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
for OK so let's get into that yeah. So many questions right give us

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
your short timeline of what happened during the Bahraini revolution and your involvement in

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
your family's involvement.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
So in two thousand and eleven I was actually living in London an exile I was under threat of for us so I had to leave

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
the country. OK Explain all that. OK so the

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
actual crackdown started in two thousand and ten it was August August thirteenth there were a few people coming back

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
from London who were political activists and who had gone there to speak about torture at the House of

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Lords and they got arrested upon arrival now I had just come back from the US Actually I

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
was teaching up probably in broad University in

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Providence and I couldn't get a job because of my last name because of my dad's work behind

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and one person is a humorous defender the entire family pays the price and so because I couldn't get

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
a job I started volunteering for the behind Center for Human Rights given that the crackdown has started and people were

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
getting

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
arrested and because of that I became under threat a for us and so in September two thousand and ten

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I had to leave they were they told me I had to leave the country within twenty four

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
hours and not tell anyone that I was leaving because I could have gotten arrested

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
so basic. I packed a bag and left the country and I don't know if I could go back but in January two thousand and love

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and once the once Tunisia in Egypt

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
happened we were like This is our turn you know like this is the time for behind as

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
well I did it is don't understand how you find the strength and the

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
energy. So I'm not going to lie there were times that were pretty difficult the most

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
so the reason why I went back to behind was because my father was on hunger strike and I was in

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Denmark at that time and I met with the hunger strike experts My father had been on several hunger strikes before one

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
of which nearly cost him his life when he went on hunger strike for hundred ten

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
days and the hunger strike expert basically told me every day that your dad is alive. The day

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
we didn't know we had and he's basically a risk of going into

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
cardiac arrest or basically going to sleep and not waking up again at any

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
time and because he's been on several hunger strikes. I was not

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
able to get media attention to this case I mean the first hunger strike a lot of media attention there was

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
huge diplomatic international

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
response but because he'd been on several hunger strike some Only nobody was really interested in the

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
story anymore. What do you feel like

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
is the power. Or the philosophy behind of the hunger strike. I feel like it's a very

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
specific

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
tool. It is the idea is that you are stripped of

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
basically every tool that you had as a human rights activist all those things all those tools that you

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
usually have are taken away from you so you use the last tool that you do have and that's

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
your own

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
body and it does make a difference because at the end of the day the specially for someone like my father was seen as.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
As a leader in the community for him to die in prison what have you been a

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
huge problem for the government and that's why they ended up force feeding him after the hundreds on the hunger

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
strike and keeping him alive because they wanted to make sure he didn't

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
die. And so that's why I decided to go back to when I knew that if I went back to behind whether I

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
was allowed and to go see my father on the left or whether I was arrested. Either way that would

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
get media attention you know the daughter was going back to see her father in

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
prison and so I loved within twenty four hours of that meeting with the hunger strikes. Birth and

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I was arrested upon arrival in the

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
airports there waiting for me right outside the airplane door. I pretended not to

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
see them and walked right back right by and there like Merriam and I continued walking there like oh how large and then I turned

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
around I was like yes.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Oh the red.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I mean I know a prison so far not going have a

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
bit. I don't have enough time left but I mean everything that I

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
know of prison first

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
of all is like American prisons and secondly it's from like shows made for entertainment so

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
like an orange the new black What is it really like and also where did you ever

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
laugh in prison like where ever like funny moments where do you ever feel like light enough to be like

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
ha ha. This is some the NAB and I can like have a funny

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
response Joe definitely I mean I treated prison like I was in a basketball training

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
camp. I was around. Yellow I would walk

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
around singing in the hall was you know I made a lot of friends with pretty much everyone who was in

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
the prison even the guards who were respectful and nice I was very nice. Actually the day

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
that I got released one of the prison guards came up to me and she's like you know so let me start crying like a little ridiculous.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
So I thought well like the whole point

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
of you know going to prison when you do what we do is you know one of the things you

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
understand is that living and laughing and being able to take

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
on prison with that

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
attitude is part of the struggle when you go in there and you're not able to laugh

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
and you're not able to sing and you're not able to have that kind of strong attitude. You've already

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
lost it sends a message that you can put us in Britain but it's not going to break

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
us part of our struggle. So you seem very disciplined and specific

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.000
about your

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
activism and I was watching the documentary we are giant which listeners can

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
watch on Netflix. If they're

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
curious and your father and your sister were talking about how they both

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
read routes and prison by Alex Haley and how much they thought about.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Like the. African-American tradition of protest.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
They talked about how the civil rights movement was a thing they often look to what are

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
your model of protest.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I read when I was twelve years old and it's one of the stories that

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
stuck and we've seen.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I mean just about every movie there is about the African-American struggle with my parents I

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
mean when armistice came out my parents you know got tickets so we went to the cinema and we watched

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
it and one of the things about my parents is that when we watch movies like that it wasn't just about. You know us going

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
and watching the movie we would actually have a conversation about it afterwards and they would always you know

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
encourage us to go and find books and read about it to learn

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
more and so this the struggle for civil rights in the United States but also

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
other struggles have been very instrumental in the way that we do our work as

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
well like what else. I mean so there's the South African struggle of

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
course and one of the things that I think is very powerful about the South African struggle is that in a

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
way from an international perspective it's similar to behind because behind also is a

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
country where because they're you know allies with Saudi Arabia and their allies with the United Kingdom

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
the United States. It means there's just no international accountability for human rights

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
crimes and so South South Africa was the same way and it took a you

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
know a struggle from the inside but also from the outside for apartheid to

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
stop in the documentary. There's footage of you confronting Hillary Clinton

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
is amazing to watch it looks like I don't even know it wasn't some fancy gallops that

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
you and. It doesn't show what happens after

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
you start talking to her what

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
happened. So it was the U.S. Islamic world forum. You know the younger brown

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
people were placed all the way in the back of the room. So there was actually quite a distance for me to go to get

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
to Hillary Clinton at that point to begin with I was sitting there and thinking my father at that point and

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
my two brothers in law and my uncle were all subjected to inforce disappearance.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
This is in two thousand and eleven this was in two thousand and eleven we weren't even sure that my father was alive.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
The Scituate. It was really bad and because he was taken away unconscious they had beat him in front of my family

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
until he was unconscious and then took him away. And so I was sitting there and her concern was right in front

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
of me and I was sitting there thinking well what can I do you know like she's right there and I

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
need to do something and so in the beginning I was thinking well maybe I should just get up and start

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
shouting something while she's talking and then I was like no that's not professional I probably will never get another meeting in

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
the U.S. if I do that. Plus it will look good for my activism in the future so I decided against it

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.000
but

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
then after she finished her speech and she was coming off the stage of course people went up to her to say hello

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
and so I started you know running across the room towards her because we're all the way in the

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
back and the old shouting and the secretary and secretary. What I didn't

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
notice is that there was actually Secret Service right behind

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
me than I was who was running the

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Cuellar allows

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
actually very lucky that I reached clear Hillary Clinton before they reached me because that would have been a whole

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.000
other story

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
new so I got to her

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
and you know I grabbed her hand to say hello and she was going to pull back but I grabbed her hand and I basically gave her

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
a run through of the train and like one point five minutes it was a great read it would agree

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
that

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
it was

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:25.000
torture

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
and she just smiled and then she said thank you for

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
coming and she walked away and now since then I've gotten uninvited

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
from an event that she was at what do you mean. So I was invited to to this event where she was

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
going to be and they were inviting woman from the Middle East and across the world and young women activists to be

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
meet with

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
her aroud Right exactly and I received an e-mail there like we'd love

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
to invite you blah blah and I was like Yeah of course I'd love to come and then I receive another e-mail saying

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
we decided to go a different

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
route but only the family invited. So how much

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.000
time had elapsed.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
From confrontation to you being an invited to this

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
thing the uninviting happened in two thousand and fourteen. I met her in two thousand and eleven.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
So they're still

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
they feel the pain and I'm a little worried about what that's going

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
to mean for my activism in the U.S. if she gets elected president. I feel like most

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
of my questions are about like feelings and emotions because I I describe myself twice a day

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
it's like one big walking emotion I'm an emotional

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
legs but like how like how do you do it.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
It's a very long struggle and I wouldn't even describe it as

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
being a pill I'd say it's a mountain. Do you feel

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
like the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
While. I'm not sure

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I would like to have hope in humanity I would like to believe that as human

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
beings we tend to move more towards justice than in justice.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
But honestly after five years of doing what I do I'm not so sure about that anymore. I

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
mean I've met with diplomats who told me to my face that they don't care about human rights they don't care about

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
children getting shot and killed and behind. I met diplomats who I would sit there are next

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
and explain to them describe to them to torture that people are being put

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
through the fact that we have children and prison and behind with their

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
mothers and will basically couldn't care less because it just doesn't fit into their

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
economic interest and one of the things that I learned early on in my

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
job was that I needed to know my audience and so when I meet people from the military I don't go

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
in there and try to appeal to their humanitarian side. You know I have to go in and present an argument

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
of why human rights are important for their security

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
interests and so just having to put myself in the position of having to you know.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Remove myself from those emotions of being part of the struggle of having my family

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
in prison and having to sit there and be like well I know you don't care about human rights but you know

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
for your security interests.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
It actually is better if you have a if you have stability

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
and when right away. How do

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
you keep moving when when you're disillusioned.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
My mother.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
So if I ever feel down or I feel like you know what's the point anymore and

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
I feel that a lot. All I need to do is talk to my mom and she's like met him like this is

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
not about you. There's a struggle there's a cause much bigger than you it's not about individuals.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
This is about entire country an entire

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
region and if you think you're tired think about these families who have had their children killed Think

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
about the people who are sitting in prison cells. You're sitting in Europe and so you have absolutely no excuse to

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
be giving up hope of these people to continue struggling. You have no excuse to give up but it's also something that

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
my father told

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
me. Before I left behind when before he got arrested which was if

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
you want to be a human rights defender you have to understand

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
that you can't do it because you're expecting results. If you expect results you're going to

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
lose hope you're not going to be able to

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
continue. You become a human rights defender because it's the right thing to do.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
You're doing the right thing because you need to do the right thing because the right thing needs to be done

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
because people's rights need to be fought for because imagine if everyone stopped doing that even if it doesn't

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
change things for the better. How much worse would it be if human rights defenders decided to no

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
longer defend human rights.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
But I don't know why it's a lot like at the same time you're human and humans get tired

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
like when you were the king. My parents say like Sorry no go ahead because I'm not going to say the

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
same thing when my parents are like children are

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
starving in Africa. Yes Yes But first of all I

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
was yeah I was

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
literally But yeah

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
like there are times when I'm like and I mean like my problems and I know and I recognize I like this

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
big compared like the problems that you're fighting obviously I mean it's out well for most of it's all relative

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
it's true but like when I have like friends who are going through it like example I had a

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
friend who was like going through some stuff and she put a status on Facebook has been

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
saying and somebody responded and was like well it could always be worse and I got so mad. So

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
upset because like that's not the point he's allowed to get hired he's allowed to be disillusioned he's allowed to

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
like sit down and like feel for herself for a

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
moment. Do you allow yourself those moments you ever get resentful at like the

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
feeling or being told that you know like you could be so much

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
worse. I don't

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
know resentful of being told that because I do also get told to take care of myself I mean both my

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
parents whenever they talk to me

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
the first question they ask is What was the last time you went to the cinema one of the last time you went out see friends

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
are you you know going out having fun and so on and so that's something that's also very important to them and my

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
father has told me time and time again that if you want to be able to do this long term you need to take

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
care of yourself because you can think about the care of others if you don't take care of

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
yourself that being said. Like I said as I was when I was a child I

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
was very stubborn and hard headed and so I don't exactly Wilson's

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
wife and I think it's largely related to the issue

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
of survivor's guilt that feeling

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
of you know I survived when others did not and so taking time off.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
You just feel so guilty that it's not even worth it. It's not even worth taking time off

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
because you feel so bad about yourself knowing that well in this moment

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I could have written a statement and this you know hour that I took off I could have done something to hope

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
someone finally enough being in prison. Those three weeks was the only time that I didn't feel

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
that way it was actually kind of like a mini vacation.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Oh wow I don't want to make it sound really Paul because I was

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
in a sense you

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
know was the only time in these five years that I didn't really feel guilty anymore.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
So how do you think or yourself.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Do you think you know.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
I think the the answer to that would be no I work pretty much most of

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
the time I mean I you know I do go out with

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
friends from time to time I do hang out with friends but usually like even when

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I'm all friends I'm on my phone I'm checking emails I'm writing I'm you know following up but it's also

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
it's very much related to the anxiety. Something of missing out on something

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
because when my father was arrested I found out from Twitter and I was sitting on

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
a train going from New York to

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Providence when I found out and just

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
that feeling of being so far away but also knowing that the only thing

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
that

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
links me to the situation there is my phone and so there is the things I did he

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
related to not being on the Internet and not having my phone around that not checking my phone because

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
I know that any bad news is always going to come through that device right. And so I have to be

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
constantly connected. I want to cycle back really

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
quickly to your fam. Documentary that you were in we

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
are giants is this is a you know with our Also there with

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
you and she's currently in prison. Yes and she is either pregnant or

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
just or has a new baby.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Yes So she was arrested on the fourteenth of March with her fifteen month old son.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Wow I don't know why would expect like humanitarian

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
concern right.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I mean you would think that generally if you say well there's a fifteen month old baby and then with his mother

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
who's being held on freedom of expression and parents will see Asian charges that people would care but it actually

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
doesn't doesn't work that way. So tell us about like what landed your sister in jail.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
So she has five cases against her she's in total I think been charged with thirteen or fifteen cases.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
She's been imprisoned I think up to ten or

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
eleven times I've lost track ten or eleven times

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
now she's been beaten she's been shot in the leg she's been pretty

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
much everything but my favorite story of Dana was she was on

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
trial for ripping a picture of the king which of course is a huge deal in

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Boston and you can get up to seven years in prison for insulting the king so

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
reading a picture of him falls under that.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
And so she was on trial for ripping a picture of the king and she basically was in a position

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
where she was boycotting the court but she knew that if she didn't go to court she would get arrested anyway if you boycott

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
the court you get picked up from your

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
home so she decided to go to court which was surprising to all of us now of course we all knew that. There

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
was something going on but of course enough doesn't really share with us what she plans on doing because she's

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
always worried that we're going to tell her not to do it and so I suddenly my phone starts ringing and I'm

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
like what's going on and that's the lawyer and he's

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
like yes osing up got up in court in front of the judge who's also a member of the ruling family.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Gave him a speech about how she's a free woman born to free parents she was eight months pregnant

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
at that point and how she told him how her son when he was born whether in a prison cell or not will be

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
a free baby boy as

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
well and then she took out a picture of the king ripped it and placed it in front of the

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
judge so much. As like this she made O'Connor ripped

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
the picture of

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000
the pope unfairly like that only a lot more for it.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
My analysis is that she was arrested because of my work. They can't get to me so they want to

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
after her her sentences are definitely related to her work and to

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
her activism and the one person protests that she stages and so on but I think that the

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
timing of the arrest right now was definitely a message to

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
me I'm trying to imagine being in your shoes which I was the I cannot because I'm a very

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
spoiled American who lives on her bubble but like your sister and your nephew are in jail

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
like what I just feel like I feel so helpless at this point is there anything

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
that you can do to try to help get her out or do you just have to wait. It's just a

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
waiting game.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I do feel helpless and that's one of the things that I discovered all early on in two thousand

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
love him when my father was arrested was the feeling of helplessness is even worse than

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
the feeling of fear and was saying open my nephew right now knowing that they're sitting in a prison

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
cell knowing that they were given blankets that are stained and dirty knowing

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
that my nephew cannot even eat the prison food and

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
they're not allowing my family to bring the baby food from the outside.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
You know all these things because I've been in prison I know what prisons like so just imagining him in there you

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
know a fifteen month old baby who's looking at the ants on the floor and thinking it's a game right.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
That definitely it breaks my heart. So the way that I deal with it

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
is of course we try to raise attention so I've been spending the past couple of like you since you got

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
arrested what I've been doing is working on statements you know contacting State

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Department

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
contacting the missions here in New York at the U.N. you know talking to the media. Pretty much trying

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
to do everything I

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
can to raise pressure on her case because that's how I got out of prison. I got out of

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
prison because it became more costly for the behind the government to keep me in prison than to let me go.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And that's what we need to do for is a you know we need to make it more costly for the behind the government to keep her

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
and I'm also currently thinking about going back to

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Holland and I'm sentenced to one year in prison and I've sent Yeah. And I have five

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
other pending cases one of

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
which is under the anti-terrorism law which can carry a life sentence.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
So I know that going back this time probably means I'm not going to get back

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
out but at the same time if I feel like I've reached a point

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
where there's nothing I can do on the outside anymore

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
that you know is just not going to cut it. I won't be able to be you know it's Europe

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
or the U.S. and knowing that my sister and my nephew are in prison so I'd rather go be in prison with

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
them than be on the outside

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
helpless and my hope is that if I do decide to go back that me being in prison will

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
actually get them released because it would be too much pressure on the government for them to have

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
all of us in prison at the same time and it would look better for them to release a woman and her baby than to release

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
me. So my hope is that if I do decide to go back and I feel like working on the outside has

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
become useless that it will result in them being

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
released

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
for a dramatic change in tone a huge shift a very sharp shift

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
in tone. Now as our fun. Rapid Fire segment which you're already familiar with

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
I don't have to explain the title cop you know.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
What is the last song that you think. That's not my name

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
please

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
take a copy say see that's one this is also my mind

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
and not mine even though they're assuming that you have games on your phone.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
I'm not alone here you got cable your phone. Like I have my cousins lately.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
The only thing I'm sure everybody understands you've got day. So you know what your favorite game

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
right now only about Need for Speed who feels a little bit like

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.000
a

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
raisin Yeah definitely Then you like you move your phone to model cars oh yeah really cool.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
I used to play this farm game where you like buy stuff and you farm shit like

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
seeds also That's like I'm really bad at the likes games of resources

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
I like a result of collecting here is really

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
cool but then I saw all the prison guards playing it so it wasn't

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
as much fun as the real

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
downer. Tell us about the

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
body's growth that you learn to make in prison.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
I have to know the first thing. OK so in prison. There's very

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
limited things that you're allowed to have so there were a bunch

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
of woman in prison with me who were basically charged with prostitution. They

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.000
were

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Moroccan and so they showed me how you can actually make body scrub

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
and oil for your hair out of like the materials we did happen prison. So

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
basically they would take sugar. So in the prison. Because it was a temporary prison facility where you go

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
before your sentence.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
There was a kitchen with very limited stuff but there was so they would take sugar and they

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
would put it with water and

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
honey and then they would put it in the fridge and then they take it out of the fridge and use a

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
scrub that is very similar to a script that I still make to this day you know like a really really

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
good script there's just like added Nobody cares about this is

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
me and coconut oil and like if you like a little thinner. The likes

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
of essential oil that's a good grip recipe I heard you also got your

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
hair done.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
mean there are some corn.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Well there are I mean I was one of the women with us and

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
friends like I said I made friends with pretty much everyone in the prison and one of them was from

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
the

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Opiah And so the girl

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
had and so she actually made you know to my parents' cornrows

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
which was really cool I mean it was really sad because there were no murders and prison. Oh I

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
think I felt like I was really

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
cool.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I'm sorry some of

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
us what it is

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
why would you give black Lab matter. Protesters. I

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
think first of all it's very important for different struggles

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
to reach without outside of their borders and I think that that's

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
something that we learned the hard way in the Middle East which

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
is you know there is no struggle that is by itself. You need to be able

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
to reach across the border and work together learn from each other share strategies

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
because there's always going to be something that you didn't know about that you can learn from

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
others and so I remember when the protests actually started in Ferguson I was one of the people that was

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
tweeting advice about what to do with tear gas when actually got picked up by the New York Times

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
the tweets that I had written along with actually fellow activists from Palestine was also tweeting about A Million Little

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Pieces and so we were very aware of the different struggles that happen and we try

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
to give an input when we can and I would actually

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
be very interested in meeting with activists from Blackledge matter I'm very like it's

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
a movement that I admire and respect very much and I think it's something that's very

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
important especially at this time and I think that they can definitely learn from

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
our struggles and we can learn from theirs as well and so that's something that I would definitely like love to

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
see happen that's for us to actually reach across borders and learn from each other.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Your eyeliner is always on point your life. What you needed it

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
was my sis's of actually talk and eyeliner

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
So I mean what can

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
the Mac. I think

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
those really the notion

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
L O

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
O is a liquid is it a pencil. So it's liquid pencil.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Oh yeah I'm

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
listening to but you also

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
have to make sure that the tip is very thin because if you use those thick ones they

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
always go wrong but if it's then you can actually decide how thick you want to make it like the bending

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
on how big your eyes

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
are seem really really bad was like really thin tip stuff. Yeah. This

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
is hard not only the hard revolutions are hard.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
We hear that you hate your wicked media page.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
I do.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Well one because it's pretty outdated. Too because I don't

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
know what made it which is not the reason why I hate it but like I don't know it. Yeah

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
like someone just tweeted me one day and I was like oh that's interesting but the

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
main reason why I hate is because my

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000
friends every time we meet someone you decide to pull up by we can you know.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Can you please not

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
like this doesn't need to be home introduce the people your friends are trolls

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
waiters and yes. So if tomorrow there was

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
world peace and you no longer had to be a human rights activist. What would you

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
do I would retire. I would like buy a little hut in the middle of

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
nowhere with no internet connection.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And just you know like just live out my days there. I think I'd probably get bored that's like three days on leave but you

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
know I think I can last there for a couple of years. But I mean

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
generally I think I really love training before I got into human rights I used to be a

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
teacher and I also used to train students on leadership skills and it

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
was a lot of fun it was something that

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
I loved doing well on that beautiful

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
No I was the suppressing.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Thank you so much for stopping by pleasurable when we're going to learn. Yes facts.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Where can people find your work does Lance

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
whatever summary Mahajan I mean R Y M L K W A J for a

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
long name. I think that's too much and I mean you can always if you Google my name you'll get tons

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000
of interviews and videos and stuff like that and you know integrate with a P.D. a page.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Thanks for stopping by Thank you my

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.000
pleasure

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
trace we've been around for I'm really excited for this because I've been around

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
for Al Sharpton on sorry one year. Let me clarify house why and why why

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
you know people have

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
their thoughts and opinions on Al Sharpton and you know I know the he's pretty

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
controversial figure is now with is around is about to go. OK I love Al

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Sharpton because he can't

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
pronounce anything. So he had a show and it was N.B.C.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
for a short time so much more confusing.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Why are you like the protester in the protests that are

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
covering and also covering the protests. Right right so he covered it. Yeah how

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
much time a conflict

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
of interest yeah that's the thing that anyway will away about Al Sharpton about but it

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
was so fun to watch because on the show he was definitely just like a

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
local event. And he's like yelling

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
about celebrities pronouncing the name was all wrong he called him a car dash

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
cam could do

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
she is like I said may

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
remember How do you not know him by then you never had a

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
saying if you've never seen any bits and pieces of Al Sharpton show.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Don't go watch actual clips of it go watch an

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
ethanol with Kenan Thompson as Al Sharpton. It's

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
exactly like that we like.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Yet I also know what you should do there the video on the Internet Scott Ashok

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
devices the teleprompter all know and is just

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
a superset of his best moments pronounced in everything he print

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
he pronounces the g at the in the Rush Limbaugh's name every time he says it. And so I

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
was the talks about my last so every time is a Rush Limbaugh

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
August Rush Limbaugh August. Rush Limbaugh

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
the Rush Limbaugh watching Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh Show rush.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Lombards hold the broom go out just go in your mile yesterday and Tony.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And Tony mean girl you Jim could dodge Jim and the Republican

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
chairman around and by Al Sharpton in the endless moments of Internet laughter that he has brought into my life

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
I would like to buy

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
around for pure heroin Lords

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
album I should have learned that sentence differently. I thought you were the best

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:00.000
assessment going on here that this was a fairly low intervention. I really did not think that sentence.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I love lard.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
She's so great. This is her album her debut album from twenty thirteen and I

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
remember when she first came out everyone is like who's this like John girl from New

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Zealand of all places. Well she said yeah well yeah yeah but she had

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
this like incredible

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
powerful voice and everyone's like Who has she has and then she really blew up and

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
it made me so happy because I'm never on the first wave of my musician

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
friends but you get to the hips there. I've been listening to her.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
I don't know what it is about Lorde

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
but she makes me feel my age. Like she lets

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
me enjoy it whereas my mom has always

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
like chastise me like act my age and I I feel like I've heard it all my life but

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
I still don't really know what that means because I feel like what she's trying to say is

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
like make more mistakes and don't take yourself so seriously breaker for me sometimes I do

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
that all the time you know. I don't think we've

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
got to see it but something about Ward's

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
music really makes me like live in the

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
moment.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
When

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
you

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
put Also she like the best celebrity like this

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
new best case scenario for what a celebrity can be.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
She's like vocal when she wants to be she's funny she's waiting she claps back.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Yes she does not stand for anyone's bullshit health as an apology as like oh if he has a lawyer.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
She'll make fun of you living where there is one time she

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
