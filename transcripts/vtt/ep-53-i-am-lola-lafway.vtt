00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We got hers and Johnny Walker Black. Yes So we are already thinking

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and to get into all the things. Let's start with prints.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
OK Are you emotionally OK to talk about France. I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
think so. OK I think it's just we're like what triggers I mean you know like

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the first couple of days I was really sad I was crying all the time I was

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in traffic and my mom had to rub my back and I just are climate the lighter playing in the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Bahamas they're playing you know but it was just really emotional for me but I'm better now.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
OK I would also love to know your hair's a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
glorious purple right now. Yeah I think the nails. Yes my finger know about purple. Oh my

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
hands purple I had my hair purple since October. It looks incredible. But

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
oh thank you it runs off on everything are damaged Tracy's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
couch you know the first alarm bell ringing on my very draining

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
couch Parminter but I think that's because all the black women products that I put

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
in it is just little cried out Oh yeah they were yeah. So they're my

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.000
couch for

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
heaven. So talk to us about how

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
you feel in love with Prince. OK So probably when I was six years old we

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
got cable for the first time and M.T.V. was like really popular I'm old by the way just

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
girl who let your so and so M.T.V. was really

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
poppin and they were playing Prince

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
stuff and this was maybe eighty three.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So yeah. So they're playing France up and they played the video for I want to

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.000
be your

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
lover and he just dance he's like topless you dance around he's like flinging on his hair and like it sure

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is gaping down to his navel and I felt like this is not

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
a woman was

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
not like is he a man like was going I didn't know what I was looking at but then he'd like to hear his

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
voice and then he was saying stuff that was kind of nasty and I just assumed then on that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and I just love him from

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.000
there

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I really feel like I imprinted on him by something because so much of my life is influenced

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
by plants. What do you say

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
more like them in that I've fallen for have some kind of prince

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
thing if it's a mole right here you know just so on achieve something that reminds you

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of yeah and I didn't really I didn't know that until maybe like

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
after thirty or so

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but that's all right just and eyebrows they're very skinny and scrawny like

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
princes a lot of the times.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The kind of his attitude or they have big eyes like he does. Something like there's always

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
something physical that reminds me of Prince of them in that I have like really

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
really fallen stupid.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
You know but why. I don't know I just like he was just

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
someone that kept me still when I would see him. You wrote an essay for

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Buzz Feed called how Prince taught me about female sexuality. Yeah. Can you please tell us more.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
OK when I thought to get like really

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
into my teenage years I would be practicing orgasm sounds based

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
on what the of the sounds based on the sound that Prince was making in his

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
soft way when you just don't

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
want to lose your place the way.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
They can you imagine like closure as in you know with someone in made in they

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
just like a real live Prince noise like

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I'm not going to be like the little

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Yeah but there's like the really

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
high pitched noises that he makes at the end of the song girl. It's a

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000
piece

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
thought sex sounded like Prince and I knew that men weren't supposed to sound

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
like that you know based on just whatever but I was like I

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
can sound like that so my first orgasm was with a guy.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
If they were doing really good shit. It was our prince

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
like you and I day I was still here. Prince found come out

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and say I'm like. So your first

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
orgasm with Prince is pretty much all right I will take that.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Yeah I love that this amazing I know.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Imagine if someone gave you the like Michael Jackson.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
think that's a good sign that. Oh my goodness that's like a sign make

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
you sound

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
like somebody else. So when. I mean that I was really excited to ask you how Prince is because neither

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
of us are like Die Hard Prince Bandar like I don't think that's a tile that we do that we love France we love

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with music but we don't have prints tattoos you know purple hair. So I'm

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
very interested in what the grieving process has been like

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
for somebody who felt such a close like intimate personal bond

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with Prince. Especially when it happened so unexpectedly like what do you

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
know it's really hard cause again I don't know what's going to make

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
me cry. When I saw the Corvette ad that said baby I was much too

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
fast I cried.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But the first day it wasn't until I heard a door. That's what it was

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that broke me down because like to hear all of that passion that

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
he

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
has towards the end when you're like

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:14.000
you don't know what you mean to be like that I can't thank you is exactly.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Anyway so it's really difficult because I feel like he's been there all of my life like that since the

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
first real solid nonfamily memory that I have is watching Prince.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
On M.T.V. part

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
of what I loved about him was he has this boldness when it came to

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
sex but also his connection to spirituality from the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
south after be a good Christian girl but Prince kind of taught me that you can

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
still honor and respect whatever your higher power is and ill honor and respect

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the desires of your body and that's very important to

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
me words I don't really feel like I have the stronger connection to primp and I already

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
feel like I've learned so much. Yeah. So I really I really feel like I understand more why people are

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
like yeah. Nah I really love listening to

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
people talk about things that they would catch. I know you so desire. Speaking of which we're going to be

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
on say who's But first refill don't

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:20.000
refill yet.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So we are back and is been kind of a disorienting

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
week for people everywhere black people especially I would say because you have this really

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
devastating thing happening in Prince dying but then you also have

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
this huge monumental joy inducing thing

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
in the visual album at the end they drop Limon A M I five in a

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
bad everybody's ass that's why I thought when it would be run out

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
of town. At least I'm not many you know should say I

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.000
LOVE THEM

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
A I've only seen the visual album three times

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in total like fully through. And I was weeping at every single

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
time so I'm very excited to weep with you all together right

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
now favorite song. Don't hurt yourself. I can't I can't I

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
can't have this conversation

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
so early in your time but I can say is

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that Doherty's that was a favorite of mine and I've only listened to tracks to through four

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
so far which are like the angriest songs. Yeah bomb because let's talk about the anger on the album.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Let's get into it so I said before that like my anger is only something that I've recently given

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
myself permission to engage with because we're just like so swayed from being angry you know the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
whole side right Rick you little black which of course somebody who fucks you over

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
would say you're right but I just love how while in truth. Well.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
She just left or

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
something completely inside

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you you.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And especially as a black woman you know there's a stereotype of the angry black woman in being able to

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
take control of that and claim it for

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
yourself in the backdrop of that stereotype your challenge in

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
a stereotype you're Apple asserting like you're personally because humans get angry and that's OK.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Also I just love cousin

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
beyond saying you know I love it so I'm like that so I have.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I haven't even heard the rest the album that much because like I just he wrote it on the

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
people by my heart is right down there ready for the sweet forgiveness

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:46.000
part where part of my brain.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
What do you make of all the conversations about their

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
marriage. Well I mean people say all the time that marriage

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
is

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
awful like the so I don't know why we should bank.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Beyond saying Jay Z. to have some kind of power perfect relationship where whatever. Like I

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
don't know any of my married friends who have not complained

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
about the institution of marriage. You know not necessarily specific

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to their husbands or wives really just they're just

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
like why do we do this kind of thing

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
but I mean it makes for good

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
gossip you know with your friends I really feel like people are making it

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
too autobiographical. Well I feel like. It can all be true and none of it can be true

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
at the same time. Absolutely I

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
think she may have modeled a lot of

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
it after the poetry word or worse in shire writing and I

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
also think there's some of her own

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
personal life experiences in there but it reminds me of something. Roxanne

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
gay said that women are only allowed to be experts of themselves

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and I think that also applies to black people which is

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
why like you have to go we have to go to court to prove that. Rap lyrics are

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.000
not real

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
right you know maybe not right they have to prove to people that when we talk

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
about artistic choices I am like we don't have imagination right.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The music that you listen to is from our imagination and I think you're talking about the acting in this country

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
song week blackly OK name it then

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Jerry Hello. Hello. Oh so all of that is just I

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
think it's a way of again to try to limit beyond say in her

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
teens her it really works.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Yeah

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
well

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that's

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
when

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I want to pick up on this we invented country.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Yes because there's a lot of parts of this album to me because I'm not from the south. Well I'm I'm from

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the part of Virginia that likes to distance himself

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
from the religion you know that's northern Virginia area in the it's a horrible name.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
You know like like the D.M.V. You know

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I remember when formation dropped. I like jokingly tweeted.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I think I understand steampunk now because it's like beyond

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
saying all this like Southern

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Gothic All right. I like the architecture the clothing it's like everywhere

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that's the whole aesthetic and I in my mind have only associated that with white

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
people so that I don't I don't have family in the south I you know I didn't grow up

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
there and like

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
now it's more I feel like she's making such a bold claim to like. The South. Yeah

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
like this is what we look like this is the music we invented and these are the spiritual reasoning.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
These are the protest songs we made up like like we've been here for ever like yeah. All

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
this shit

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
yes we literally did I think part of that is becoming apparent I'm not a parent but

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
just from what I've seen. And talk to other people I think part of that is what do you want to pass on

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
to your child so she's thinking what do I want to give Blue Ivy and whoever else comes

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
along you know part of me that is not just mommy on stage or

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
whatever and so she's really kind of anchored herself in those southern roots particularly as she

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
gets closer to her mom and her mom's Louisiana Louisiana roots I mean.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Have

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
you have you all been reading any of the reviews. You

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
know I haven't I just really truly could not tolerate any conversation about

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
this that wasn't coming from a black

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
woman but you did not hear it here I can see I don't personally love my

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
wife Morgan the real thing that we did by the way home phone last

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
night with black people that you know we really like Holly Bass I feel like if we went to his

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
house and looked up his porn history would be a fellow Lebanese laptop

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
yet you know Ebony it would be archived to

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
like that absolutely like a couple porn.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yeah well he's watches blacks right now.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yeah all right all right

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and that also I feel like one of the things I

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.000
find

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
so tickles me truly does is when. So there's this

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
iconic line about. Thank you with the good here. My guys

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
why people are losing he better call

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
you first of all.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Iggy Azalea when I go home you have back you that's offensive.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Do you think

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
down near you.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
But there is just sense and. I feel like white girls do this thing where like they know they're not

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
a part of something like not explicitly about me so I'm going to turn these into

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
about yeah. And there is this like there are these articles that like to Mbeki with the

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
good. What was the thing that

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
happened earlier the camera thing British Glamour. Taken

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
back Becky or something like taking back baccy.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
This also now you know when the phrase didn't happen

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
when basic The phrase or the word BASIC was blah. Mind you know what let me

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
recall. I finally found my oppression All

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
my God I find

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
it so wild how white people cannot consume a product that is not at

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
least where the rest of the world has been doing that

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
their entire lives and they can even quietly not can write it and you can just not

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
hit play right now you could just not sweet you think you cannot write articles may cost you nothing.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Free ninety nine.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
This is also show me that white people have no idea what good hair is what I

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
mean. So I like these you know their hair is

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
excellent analogy I think

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
what I haven't said You tweeted that Becky with a good hair is actually a state

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
of ideas or something less out of Iran to

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
stand behind not agree with that I think that she's just

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
really there somebody other. Yeah. And my mother who's

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
going to hate me that I think my mother

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
is like yeah B. I say she got some rough stuff so I mean by

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
that I don't know I would never said that behind not

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
come for us not to be I don't want to say I'm delighted angel my mother and I

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
know it's little

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
mama But I think do you think

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
a Becky is necessarily white.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I think this is happy

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
as they threw us off because of the history of good here. It's what's

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
closest to whiteness. Right right and so you don't need to

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
qualify white daddy. That's a given. Yeah right. See what made me

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
feel like this is pretty autobiographical. I mean there's all the direct references to Jay

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Z. Yeah that I assume.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Like Beyonce and Jay Z. make music together. Yeah like I know he knows what was going in

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
there and he's like I respect your decisions as an artist you're allowed to tell your truth

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
like I'm sorry and I deserve.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yeah I can publicly say me please. By dragging me I'm a drag you tell me in the

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
video literally at my yes actually the My how I am in front of everybody

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
else can I say

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
that one of the things I think just on a kind of abstract relationship level that we need to look

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
at from lemonade is a way of shaming the quote unquote actually

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Larry all the people who try to tell you if you're a good girl were no one's going to cheat on

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
you right. But if a queen gets cheated on you know then anybody can

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
get cheated on and. Oh yeah I

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
try to sit there say well only Queens deserve respect you got to carry yourself like and rightly said OK but we

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
have Queen Bee who's being the

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Right now the the escalators on what I like to be I say a girl woman man Jay

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Z. cheated on her she even don't

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
know why. Yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Daisy's money comes back to making the women after hallway or something. Not

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
always just continuously but I want to backtrack a little bit about baking with my back

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
you know yeah. I got that drug. Yeah because the Internet

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
has been so adamantly saying it's this one woman Rachel Roy not to

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
be confused with Rachel right from the food.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So she's some type of brown she was yeah I think

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
you're some type of

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
BROWN Yeah I think her father.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Anyways the Internet. Yeah like this is like they have a theory about it's her gift. So I feel

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
like that he is a definite reference to whiteness. I think

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
that people who are deemed quote not black enough are like some sort of like

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
quote exotic black or whatever and they the implication is that they are

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
not

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
like in touch with like they're brown and so whatever then they too can be

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
considered the baccy that is how I'm your preemie too I don't because you would. White girls don't have good

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
hair white girls have white right.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
You know well we know how to get white girl

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
her we hope for good hair right. So that's not a

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
characteristic that an actual Bheki would have I don't think. Do you think a baccy has to be light

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
skinned.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Well you know. I don't know. But kind of to go back

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
to the stuff I

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
am because and there's I there's a rumor that it's read or are writing.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Oh yeah I see move or just fall out like you might want to I don't know you know

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
because she's white and she looks like we all know somebody said to her as to current

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
U.K. I'm

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
not is that so how do you

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Tracey that was me this whole area but Rita Ora did step out

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
like the day after Let me drop in the sack same dress Bianchi was information. Yes right and she

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.000
also said

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
that yes a picture of her with a bra with women's over

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
her nipples. She knew she was yes and then I got up and the necklace that she

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
wore people thought it was a J. It was an initial And that well my guy said

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
listen I love the Internet's the best record in the onet were Abenaki

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
with the good hair. I would say nothing.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Yeah you know why doesn't want it I don't want those particular problems. Not this month.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
One other thing I really love about how does outspoken and honest this album is is

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
that Beyonce just started her tour her first show in Miami happened and she

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
selling March that says boycott

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
beyond saying I could let all this nomination about.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
After formation drop that like it's anti cops unlike the copyrights we willing

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
to send her when she's in town for the concert or something

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
like we won't please think beyond thirty years almost all I'm going to like you know what boycott me. We

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
all got to be sure that it was the best in

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
class he's a way of saying I was in a global

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
you know if I'm not OK all of these areas I want you to look how

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
well you know

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
exactly. Do also I want to get back what you were saying about the cursing on the

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
album because I do think it's

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
a pretty new and I like it like OK For example one of my

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
favorite lines on girls who run the world is I think

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I need a barber because none of these blank can fade me its

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.000
purposes is

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
that

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I couldn't tell if it was bitches or none of these niggas to bait me. I definitely was niggas.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I didn't yeah no way saying it bitches I've been thinking oh.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
That was me it makes sense.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
It's like niggas who are cutting your hair my barber to be native but

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
maybe it's also the bitches can't they maybe they just don't want to say you

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
know. You say Oh yeah. My point is my

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
point is. Like she would definitely make a point to not curse that much before yeah like it really

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
feels like she's like no you're gonna hear me as I speak yeah talking to Lenny myself. Yeah that's why

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
when she hit thirty she was like fuck this. Yeah it is yeah but that isn't it. I assure you but

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I need a

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
full two thousand and eleven when she started her own management company and stop working with her father's

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
her manager not been for dropped in like all the like in every she's given about four

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
it was like. I'm on a new path I feel like I've done a lot in my life but I've learned

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
the right to be like I talk my

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
shit yet say it in my voice. Oh and I punch you saying i use of my mom

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
with my friend with whatever you know. See I'm around the big beyond their Destiny's

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Child when they were high. I don't know I didn't feel like that they were really for me and there are

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
couple of songs that I really like but they were the songs where they were

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
very sad and it was a very had an influence on Get Me Bodied is very sad

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
and it's found music you know and the influence of that and so I really like that

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
so anytime she did that and. Can you keep saying you know

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.000
what's

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
funny. Yes Jim

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I'm not ready yet is

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
very well done I woke up and staggered on that's OK. You know without

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
a sound of a marching band a setting a school marching band you know that kind of stuff

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I love her so now she's getting older. She's still like you know with the anchoring down in

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
that southern If I were a model. I would

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:36.000
do

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
before we wrap up to talk a little bit more about the visuals of this iconic film.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Yes yes I again like I was saying about the Southern like Gothic

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
like textures and

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
everything automatically I felt more connected to the south but also it

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
was just like so beautiful so beautiful to see like this Losh.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Yeah in landscape there standing on these like incredibly strong looking

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
like you have legs and I bonded in a like out here it was

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
so beautiful just to see that many brown women come together that yes like bright out

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Frewen Baskin and brown women who have all been attacked by white folks in the media.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
This is true than daya than I am for a lot Amandla a man loves a while here

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
because she's taught I don't even think about that and I think that's the reason I mean yeah when

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
launching a women like people can even respect her name Yeah I don't treat her like she's a grown person even

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
though she's a child and then Serena Williams Well

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
yeah she's a black person in the why is fuckin sport. Yeah and it

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
means so much to visually

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
see language like a wide range of black people and like

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
African print which I thought was beautifully like infuse in like natural layer

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
because that particular landscape what we were saying earlier is something that black people are not associated with but

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
like we are they are like in a lot of those places in areas there were more of us and there were white

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
folk but we just see like. White men with like long gray beards or

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
whatever like that like they're like men grabbing their back drop in just reminds me of when statement he

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
was like You can't be what you can't see if you've never seen what you

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
were the third you just don't know that was like a thing

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
or possibly I have seen criticism that Bianca did not include

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
any plus size or more full figured women which I think

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
is I think that's a valid concern because also her Ivy park BRAND

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Yeah

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
it's cater towards plus sizes I think it has about its size twelve or something of a

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
forty something like that are supposed to fit twelve to fourteen five hundred fourteen. I have

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
also noticed that in her Mirch store. She's made a point to

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
have versity of models

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
of like all you know them sizes. Yeah but not. I haven't seen. Yeah.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
So I think that that's kind of I think that's a valid concern and I understand people are pushing back on that like she

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
can't represent everybody but a family member. Yeah yeah you know if you want to talk

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
about being from the south we're no we are some big five down

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
the right. Yeah right. They come down to well the ones

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
that final five things you like collabs cameos

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
ad libs anything I just love it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I really really really love how unashamed she is a farce otherness. I just love

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
it is beautiful. I'm really loving the Malcolm X. sample some of it.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Respect the person in America is the black

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
woman the most protected one person in America is the black

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
woman holding the greatest person in America is a black woman.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
She's like oh yeah I was too black. Then. Checked it out and

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
I really love. The visual of her jumping off

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
the ledge and falling into water.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
I gasped. Yeah I was listening to some old movies of her and she was saying like I love

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
the ocean so much. I feel like in a past life I was a mermaid you give me all this

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
perspective. Oh then that maybe was OK Well I

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
don't know because you know that there's a lot

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
of your A Oh sure and you mean stuff like

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
that in there. So maybe you mean. In a ratio who's

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
kind of like a mermaid you know the mommy wars trying to the Navy. So I wonder

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
if you know she was

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
getting schooled on that and then putting that into she's definitely been on tumblr. Yeah but I

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
also really love all

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
the West African and East Africa on the album. You got your you got your weekend.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
You got shit you got worse and shyer Somali British you know it

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
and then you got your West African looks. No one's African spiritual influence

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
of you

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
be a Saudi Can a very quick confession.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
I will probably requested this because but I am not a fan of six until

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I was just like I don't like the weekend I don't think that this song

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
is

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
great that's a larger easy quick question. I hate one part of freedom.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
So I already know what it is it just climax to the worst

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
the lines the sometimes he does that like well I don't write the line

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
is because I'm a winner and a winner don't quit on themselves yeah like we went from protest

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
and song to generic like the morning and just go around a football team

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
and some of like Probably

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
fifty's. But yes yes i will we will be

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I think it is modern time and I think it's it's just that

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:49.000
to

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I feel like I as Tracy Clayton who has a podcast to her mother listens to harm

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000

race inseminated the masculinity etc etc Since you and I talk about

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.000
with with me

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
and lolo with heaven let me all right

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
let's get into it we ask you all for some questions via Twitter and email and here's a

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
few We're going to answer now. All right so the

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
question is this is admittedly a humble brag like a

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
half brain. The question is say I'm getting the job done a couple three

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
times a couple Sorry but I think there's a couple more in there what's a polite way

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
to ask all my

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
gosh I feel I want to so this is clearly coming from a man.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
OK

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
so this person wants to know how you can get back in there to get a few more

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
the chamber I guess when they ask you a job interview like what's your

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
greatest weakness.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
You know like I care too much you know such a perfectionist that

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
your Duda I can go all night long. I think

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
you should

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
just you know kind of check your part out see if that person is can

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
go physically because you know everybody has

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
different. Yeah.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Yeah. And just also you know sometimes you should. Gets tired. Yeah yeah.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
So I think you should just check I don't know about being polite I

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
don't think that's you know you can't be polite in a situation like that like I mean do you want to go again you

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
just kind of oh yeah I like it when the day you

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
just maybe just roll over and. Put the erect penis

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.000
on the hip hop right

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
in between the funny.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yes. Not quite as

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
much

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
in bed and you're kind of

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
like you know maybe you were you know going for that third or fourth round you know sure you just kind of roll

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
over and let the person know that you're Yeah basically ready. Hey yeah Hey yeah. Hey.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Not not. That's a horrible.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Oh well I mean why don't they knock

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
about how do you

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
know. But I mean

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
like ideally they would see like how you respond to like if you like argue back a

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
little bit exaggerated a little booty to come

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
out something that you know I know I know what exactly do we need to do

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
to do

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
that to you I hear that they roll over like away from you and then you

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
know right or they like push you. So you're mostly body language. Yes. Yeah.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
And the body

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
language is very important. Yeah I would like to vocalize a thing that has started to call me

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
some concern. Because I like when a nuff was

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
enough

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
times where

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Lola. LOSEN Like I said

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I'm cool. You know my hyperbole little bit I feel like I've been passed out and then they'll be like going

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
to pass out it's OK.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
No not right that that's bothersome right. It's high hand if you

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
trust that person but

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
what we've done way back up for whatever medical reason I know you're

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Bonaire about that are dying and you know if someone does. I'm scared going

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
to pass out I've learned to like I'm not going to say I can go ahead.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
That was all me to help

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
me seek him out. Call

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
attention

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
and I think it also this is if they're going to keep going when you pass out like or they say oh I never

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
thought about that oh my god it was No my concern is sexy podcast.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
OK first you have to have this kind of communication between you guys right

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
like I'm a pass out but it's OK if you keep going back right happened between you

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
know people entering adult if they've talked about it and they've you know what I

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
have to sometimes is you know when they're saying go ahead do what you have to do.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
They're just encouraging you to let

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
go OK Be safe school.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Oh I get it absolutely.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Yeah I do lately

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
really depends on how comfortable you are yeah that's definitely true. I think for me it's

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
just all about me and my fear of dying in terrible ways I think your partner should be attuned to that.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Yeah I'm saying you're right you're right let's move on to the next question.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
This next question comes from somebody that we can of accosted at a bar last night

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
when we were like a guy we got a black adds with a question.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
We got a really good

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
question and that question in so many words is that this woman and her boyfriend

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
live together they have a camera so black monitor the dogs actions. When

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
they're away. Why is a particularly destructive doll like what are they what do

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
they do with the knowledge to come running home. We

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
see you on the camera thought. It was

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
actually a great job and I don't know if I'm going to found

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
it. So she wants to use the dog camera for sexy time and

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
she's trying to because I guess they like check it while they like like want it work yes OK

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
your boyfriend can operated be a remote. So he can yeah.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
So he wants to know how to present that idea to her boyfriend was the best way to broach the

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
topic is important now that he does not like surprises. He likes to

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
be aware in the control and he would also have to make sure that it doesn't show up on

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
his work computer so they have to be some kind of

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
discussion beforehand right. She can just surprise him right away he would be doing this on his

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
work computer like you can plug into the surveillance. Yeah his phone.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
I don't know the great question we should not think it is.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So first of all this idea is super fuckin high. I think you want to put on a

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
show

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
for your partner and yes really. I also think it's great that she's you know want to make

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
sure that she has his consent because maybe he's not really into that. Yeah. So

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
she wants to let him know. So what I would say I'm about the

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
modified surprise so I would kind of ask you

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
know ask about his day. Upcoming days can be really busy at work

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
do you think you have time to maybe sit with me for like thirty minutes or something and she can like act like it's going to

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
be something totally different and then she's like maybe you could turn on the dog

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
cam are whatever and then what would be excellent and I don't know if they have this capability

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
is if you could I love that you're all right so that's why I know we so much.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Yeah I think knowledge but if he could

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
like. Mike in and say OK now toss your hair this way you

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
know oh that would be really great and that still gives him control so he doesn't feel like he's

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
left out of the scenario you know I'm yeah I'm ahead but if you can't do that then I still think

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
that she should just go for it and just put on whatever show. She wants for him that you

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
know you should do but how does she present idea to him

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
I owe by asking him how sure we're going and things

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
getting really crazy. I don't expose what we say right now and then

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
maybe if this

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
couple is a type where she's asking how she can you know put on a show for him that they

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
probably watch porn together and maybe she can do so you know let's watch some voyeur kind of

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.000
stuff or

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
so whatever. And so that you know

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
maybe. Valium around do something. Yeah that kind of thing so that again he doesn't

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
know exactly what she's planning but they're in the ballpark. Yeah. So I don't think she should flat

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
out say is it OK if

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
I take some of the sex yeah yeah I think it should be a surprise and

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
something like Wow you're really thinking of me this is really spicing up for sure and if he doesn't like surprises.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Right but. Modify a modified surprise. I do say that I hate surprises.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.000
I will hear it

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
for modified somewhat here barely but I'd like a little heads up

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
like some in the meeting should be more like can you have complete alone time at work right.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Like yeah and we just talk some days or whatever and then spring it

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
on

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
exactly the modified the proud ladies and gentlemen. You're here for back

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
to work. I think we have time for when

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
more is another animal question what's the best way to be on

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
top and maintain stamina and not hurt your knees and

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
hips and this is written by a straight woman. Honestly you just have to practice and just

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
be doing it exercise and get your body used to being in those different positions that get really.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Yeah squats and lunges all that kind of stuff to strengthen

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
your legs and that's not a very sexy answer because you know people don't like to

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
exercise my dog food it might not be clued

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
in but really that's just really all you can do is just keep doing it over and

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
over and over again which is not a bad form is and I think that's one factor that I

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
think they're worried about hurting their knees. There was like a past that you wish

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
and

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
oh I just thought of a great call

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
in question. Sex injuries.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I mean and we would love to hear your stories of sex injuries everybody.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
I have one. It

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
was very painful. What happened

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
though I will tell you that you know it is

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
when I was with my ex a thousand years ago and.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
There was

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
some oral appreciation going oh right. OK. And at one

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
point either he made a quick mover

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
I made a quick move in so my tongue was like on the roof of my

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
mouth and his penis was underneath my tongue right. And you

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
know what a lingual frenulum is like in my soul he says skin anything.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
I hear a

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
pop outside my ear. And I feel this

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
hot searing pain and I was like why what just happened to

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
me how much I liked him at the time right. We were still cool

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
minces I don't want to interrupt things. So let me just get go

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
and in all of this is horrible I will pain that I was in oh my God

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I'm really in

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
B.P. right. LOL afraid the real him.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000

Show host or great. Oh my God I wasn't

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
I mean I don't OK so maybe we'll talk about this later so what

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I do like really skinny scrawny min. But I like.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
like to make them feel powerful. So if they can handle me then they're you know that

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
makes them feel good. Yeah I'm the one with the real power because you're controlling them thinking that they can

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Yeah you learn a lot. What is the best or favorite thing

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
that you've ever written. I found

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
a story just other day that I had written. It's kind

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
of dark. But it was

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000
about a man invited

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
his ex-wife and her husband over for dinner because they wanted to take custody of

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
the kids full custody of the kids and go around the world. So you buy them over to dinner and he had

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
his cook prepare the children for them.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Oh my God Is there a place we can go to be there you know

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
I know it's just something I typed up really oh my God I look forward to more talk

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
is neglected. But I might post it there. If you if you get the blog going again

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000

I love Mama day and

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I will recommend it anytime someone asks me for a book

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
recommendation. Sonia Sanchez is who I emulated when

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
I first discovered poetry and Dorothy Parker

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
who Prince put me onto my Mothers Against song

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
of

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
song sign of the times my favorite album and he has a song called Ballad of

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Dorothy Parker and I want to know who that was

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
thinking oh my god it's beautiful it is yeah. So you not too long ago.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Quit your nine to five so that you can pursue writing full time. What has been

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
the scariest and most rewarding things

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
about that. The scariest is the uncertainty of

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
money not having health insurance anymore.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
I actually gave away my car because I was like This is too

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
expensive and gave it away to sell it. No I just like I was it was

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
still like a note. So I know which is not good for your credit what I was like I

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
can't the stress of trying to make sure that I was hustling enough to get. At least my car

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
note words are really stressing me the fuck out like I was anxious I was there I could feel myself going back into

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
depression and so I was like I need to get rid of this car so I did that which is

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
difficult as I'm in the south

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
and it's not the most walkable in the it's not at all

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
likes a lot and they were that's literally don't have sidewalks. You have to drive anyway

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
so that's the scariest just also.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Like Part B. of that is trying to hunt down your money and trying to balance how well.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
How do you. Yeah how do you ask for money that's all to you without

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
making I don't I don't want them to not want to work with me anymore because I don't want them to think

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:41.000
I'm being greedy to

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
get the money that I deserve that I've earned I should say not deserve with you know I am

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
based on our contract together. But then I have to kind of

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
find you to get my money. And I don't want you to think oh maybe we don't need to

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
work with her anymore she's going to harass us about her money to fucking pay online

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
that in the harassment like quite literally Yeah but the most rewarding part is having the

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
freedom to do whatever I want to

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
do and not be beholden to somebody like feeling like

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
oh I've got to do all the stuff in my nine to five and also do another nine to five. Because I'm a

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
slow writer. So I meet the time to

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
work on the last word

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
